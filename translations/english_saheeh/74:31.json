{"name":"74:31","price":"(31) And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels. And We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve - that those who were given the Scripture will be convinced and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] and the disbelievers will say, \"What does Allāh intend by this as an example?\" Thus does Allāh send astray whom He wills and guide whom He wills. And none knows the soldiers of your Lord except Him. And it [i.e., mention of the Fire] is not but a reminder to humanity.","arabic":"وَمَا جَعَلۡنَآ أَصۡحَٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ إِلَّا مَلَٰٓئِكَةٗۖ وَمَا جَعَلۡنَا عِدَّتَهُمۡ إِلَّا فِتۡنَةٗ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيَسۡتَيۡقِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَيَزۡدَادَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓاْ إِيمَٰنٗا وَلَا يَرۡتَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَ وَلِيَقُولَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٞ وَٱلۡكَٰفِرُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلٗاۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهۡدِي مَن يَشَآءُۚ وَمَا يَعۡلَمُ جُنُودَ رَبِّكَ إِلَّا هُوَۚ وَمَا هِيَ إِلَّا ذِكۡرَىٰ لِلۡبَشَرِ","category":["74 (Al-Muddathir)","Al-Muddathir","Surah Al-Muddathir","Chapter Al-Muddathir","Muddathir","Surah Muddathir","Chapter Muddathir","Al Muddathir","Surah Al Muddathir","Chapter Al Muddathir","Surah 74","Chapter 74","The Cloaked One","المدثر"],"ayahNumber":5526,"juzNumber":29,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wamā jaʿalnā aṣḥāba al-nāri illā malāikatan wamā jaʿalnā ʿiddatahum illā fit'natan lilladhīna kafarū liyastayqina alladhīna ūtū al-kitāba wayazdāda alladhīna āmanū īmānan walā yartāba alladhīna ūtū al-kitāba wal-mu'minūna waliyaqūla alladhīna fī qulūbihim maraḍun wal-kāfirūna mādhā arāda al-lahu bihādhā mathalan kadhālika yuḍillu al-lahu man yashāu wayahdī man yashāu wamā yaʿlamu junūda rabbika illā huwa wamā hiya illā dhik'rā lil'bashari ","translations":["And not","We have made","keepers","(of) the Fire","except","Angels","And not","We have made","their number","except","(as) a trial","for those who","disbelieve ","that may be certain","those who","were given","the Scripture","and may increase","those who","believe","(in) faith","and not","may doubt","those who","were given","the Scripture","and the believers","and that may say","those","in","their hearts","(is) a disease","and the disbelievers","What","(does) intend","Allah","by this","example","Thus","does let go astray","Allah","whom","He wills","and guides","whom","He wills","And none","knows","(the) hosts","(of) your Lord","except","Him","And not","it","(is) but","a reminder","to (the) human beings","(31)"],"transliterationArr":["wamā","jaʿalnā","aṣḥāba","al-nāri","illā","malāikatan","wamā","jaʿalnā","ʿiddatahum","illā","fit'natan","lilladhīna","kafarū","liyastayqina","alladhīna","ūtū","al-kitāba","wayazdāda","alladhīna","āmanū","īmānan","walā","yartāba","alladhīna","ūtū","al-kitāba","wal-mu'minūna","waliyaqūla","alladhīna","fī","qulūbihim","maraḍun","wal-kāfirūna","mādhā","arāda","al-lahu","bihādhā","mathalan","kadhālika","yuḍillu","al-lahu","man","yashāu","wayahdī","man","yashāu","wamā","yaʿlamu","junūda","rabbika","illā","huwa","wamā","hiya","illā","dhik'rā","lil'bashari",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,590],[2,590,2800],[3,2800,3770],[4,3770,5390],[5,5390,6220],[6,6220,8930],[7,8930,9910],[8,9910,10930],[9,10930,12140],[10,12140,12860],[11,12860,13640],[12,13640,14950],[13,14950,15790],[14,15790,17040],[15,17040,18080],[16,18080,18620],[17,18620,19640],[18,19640,20780],[19,20780,21730],[20,21730,24000],[21,24000,25020],[22,25020,25950],[23,25950,26420],[24,26420,27390],[25,27390,28450],[26,28450,28990],[27,28990,30050],[28,30050,31560],[29,31560,32600],[30,32600,33550],[31,33550,33990],[32,33990,35820],[33,35820,37340],[34,37340,38850],[35,38850,40950],[36,40950,41660],[37,41660,42550],[38,42550,43520],[39,43520,45000],[40,45000,45960],[41,45960,46720],[42,46720,47530],[43,47530,47670],[44,47670,50940],[45,50940,51890],[46,51890,52070],[47,52070,53230],[48,53230,55750],[49,55750,55910],[50,55910,57010],[51,57010,57740],[52,57740,58610],[53,58610,59320],[54,59320,60180],[55,60180,60700],[56,60700,61640],[57,61640,62050],[58,62050,62840],[59,62840,63660],[60,63660,64485]]}}
