{"name":"48:29","price":"(29) Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allāh; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allāh and [His] pleasure. Their sign is in their faces from the effect of prostration [i.e., prayer]. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that He [i.e., Allāh] may enrage by them[1518] the disbelievers. Allāh has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.","arabic":"مُّحَمَّدٞ رَّسُولُ ٱللَّهِۚ وَٱلَّذِينَ مَعَهُۥٓ أَشِدَّآءُ عَلَى ٱلۡكُفَّارِ رُحَمَآءُ بَيۡنَهُمۡۖ تَرَىٰهُمۡ رُكَّعٗا سُجَّدٗا يَبۡتَغُونَ فَضۡلٗا مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ وَرِضۡوَٰنٗاۖ سِيمَاهُمۡ فِي وُجُوهِهِم مِّنۡ أَثَرِ ٱلسُّجُودِۚ ذَٰلِكَ مَثَلُهُمۡ فِي ٱلتَّوۡرَىٰةِۚ وَمَثَلُهُمۡ فِي ٱلۡإِنجِيلِ كَزَرۡعٍ أَخۡرَجَ شَطۡـَٔهُۥ فَـَٔازَرَهُۥ فَٱسۡتَغۡلَظَ فَٱسۡتَوَىٰ عَلَىٰ سُوقِهِۦ يُعۡجِبُ ٱلزُّرَّاعَ لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ ٱلۡكُفَّارَۗ وَعَدَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ مِنۡهُم مَّغۡفِرَةٗ وَأَجۡرًا عَظِيمَۢا","category":["48 (Al-Fath)","Al-Fath","Surah Al-Fath","Chapter Al-Fath","Fath","Surah Fath","Chapter Fath","Al Fath","Surah Al Fath","Chapter Al Fath","Surah 48","Chapter 48","The Victory","الفتح"],"ayahNumber":4612,"juzNumber":26,"footnotes":"[1518]- The given examples depict the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"},"meta":{"transliteration":"muḥammadun rasūlu al-lahi wa-alladhīna maʿahu ashiddāu ʿalā al-kufāri ruḥamāu baynahum tarāhum rukkaʿan sujjadan yabtaghūna faḍlan mina al-lahi wariḍ'wānan sīmāhum fī wujūhihim min athari al-sujūdi dhālika mathaluhum fī al-tawrāti wamathaluhum fī al-injīli kazarʿin akhraja shaṭahu faāzarahu fa-is'taghlaẓa fa-is'tawā ʿalā sūqihi yuʿ'jibu al-zurāʿa liyaghīẓa bihimu al-kufāra waʿada al-lahu alladhīna āmanū waʿamilū al-ṣāliḥāti min'hum maghfiratan wa-ajran ʿaẓīman ","translations":["Muhammad","(is the) Messenger","of Allah","and those who","(are) with him","(are) firm","against","the disbelievers","and merciful","among themselves","You see them","bowing","and prostrating","seeking","Bounty","from Allah","from Allah","and pleasure","Their mark","(is) on","their faces","from","(the) trace","(of) the prostration","That","(is) their similitude","in","the Taurah","And their similitude","in","the Injeel","(is) like a seed","(which) sends forth","its shoot","then strengthens it","then it becomes thick","and it stands","upon","its stem","delighting","the sowers","that He (may) enrage","by them","the disbelievers","Allah has promised","Allah has promised","those who","believe","and do","righteous deeds","among them","forgiveness","and a reward","great","(29)"],"transliterationArr":["muḥammadun","rasūlu","al-lahi","wa-alladhīna","maʿahu","ashiddāu","ʿalā","al-kufāri","ruḥamāu","baynahum","tarāhum","rukkaʿan","sujjadan","yabtaghūna","faḍlan","mina","al-lahi","wariḍ'wānan","sīmāhum","fī","wujūhihim","min","athari","al-sujūdi","dhālika","mathaluhum","fī","al-tawrāti","wamathaluhum","fī","al-injīli","kazarʿin","akhraja","shaṭahu","faāzarahu","fa-is'taghlaẓa","fa-is'tawā","ʿalā","sūqihi","yuʿ'jibu","al-zurāʿa","liyaghīẓa","bihimu","al-kufāra","waʿada","al-lahu","alladhīna","āmanū","waʿamilū","al-ṣāliḥāti","min'hum","maghfiratan","wa-ajran","ʿaẓīman",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1790],[2,1790,2980],[3,2980,3900],[4,3900,6280],[5,6280,7990],[6,7990,10340],[7,10340,13440],[8,13440,13840],[9,13840,15160],[10,15160,17769],[11,17769,19279],[12,19279,20399],[13,20399,22169],[14,22169,23099],[15,23099,23919],[16,23919,25139],[17,25139,25819],[18,25819,27059],[19,27059,28019],[20,28019,29839],[21,29839,31449],[22,31449,31889],[23,31889,33049],[24,33049,34559],[25,34559,35159],[26,35159,38439],[27,38439,39349],[28,39349,40339],[29,40339,40569],[30,40569,43419],[31,43419,45159],[32,45159,45399],[33,45399,47489],[34,47489,48599],[35,48599,49379],[36,49379,50399],[37,50399,51879],[38,51879,53219],[39,53219,54239],[40,54239,54889],[41,54889,56049],[42,56049,56819],[43,56819,58169],[44,58169,59309],[45,59309,59879],[46,59879,60889],[47,60889,62649],[48,62649,63689],[49,63689,64649],[50,64649,65659],[51,65659,66919],[52,66919,67659],[53,67659,69189],[54,69189,69879],[55,69879,71799],[56,71799,72919],[57,72919,75314]]}}
