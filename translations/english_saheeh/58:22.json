{"name":"58:22","price":"(22) You will not find a people who believe in Allāh and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allāh and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those - He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit[1648] from Him. And We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Allāh is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him - those are the party of Allāh. Unquestionably, the party of Allāh - they are the successful.","arabic":"لَّا تَجِدُ قَوۡمٗا يُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلۡيَوۡمِ ٱلۡأٓخِرِ يُوَآدُّونَ مَنۡ حَآدَّ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ وَلَوۡ كَانُوٓاْ ءَابَآءَهُمۡ أَوۡ أَبۡنَآءَهُمۡ أَوۡ إِخۡوَٰنَهُمۡ أَوۡ عَشِيرَتَهُمۡۚ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ ٱلۡإِيمَٰنَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٖ مِّنۡهُۖ وَيُدۡخِلُهُمۡ جَنَّٰتٖ تَجۡرِي مِن تَحۡتِهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَاۚ رَضِيَ ٱللَّهُ عَنۡهُمۡ وَرَضُواْ عَنۡهُۚ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ حِزۡبُ ٱللَّهِۚ أَلَآ إِنَّ حِزۡبَ ٱللَّهِ هُمُ ٱلۡمُفۡلِحُونَ","category":["58 (Al-Mujadila)","Al-Mujadila","Surah Al-Mujadila","Chapter Al-Mujadila","Mujadila","Surah Mujadila","Chapter Mujadila","Al Mujadila","Surah Al Mujadila","Chapter Al Mujadila","Surah 58","Chapter 58","The Pleading Woman","المجادلة"],"ayahNumber":5126,"juzNumber":28,"footnotes":"[1648]- i.e., \"that which gives life,\" explained as the guidance of the Qur’ān or victory over their opponents.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"},"meta":{"transliteration":"lā tajidu qawman yu'minūna bil-lahi wal-yawmi al-ākhiri yuwāddūna man ḥādda al-laha warasūlahu walaw kānū ābāahum aw abnāahum aw ikh'wānahum aw ʿashīratahum ulāika kataba fī qulūbihimu al-īmāna wa-ayyadahum birūḥin min'hu wayud'khiluhum jannātin tajrī min taḥtihā al-anhāru khālidīna fīhā raḍiya al-lahu ʿanhum waraḍū ʿanhu ulāika ḥiz'bu al-lahi alā inna ḥiz'ba al-lahi humu al-muf'liḥūna ","translations":["You will not find","You will not find","a people","who believe","in Allah","and the Day","the Last","loving","(those) who","oppose","Allah","and His Messenger","even if","they were","their fathers","or","their sons","or","their brothers","or","their kindred","Those ","He has decreed","within","their hearts","faith","and supported them","with a spirit","from Him","And He will admit them","(to) Gardens","flow","from","underneath it","the rivers","will abide forever","in it","Allah is pleased","Allah is pleased","with them","and they are pleased","with Him","Those","(are the) party","(of) Allah","No doubt","Indeed","(the) party","(of) Allah","they","(are) the successful ones","(22)"],"transliterationArr":["lā","tajidu","qawman","yu'minūna","bil-lahi","wal-yawmi","al-ākhiri","yuwāddūna","man","ḥādda","al-laha","warasūlahu","walaw","kānū","ābāahum","aw","abnāahum","aw","ikh'wānahum","aw","ʿashīratahum","ulāika","kataba","fī","qulūbihimu","al-īmāna","wa-ayyadahum","birūḥin","min'hu","wayud'khiluhum","jannātin","tajrī","min","taḥtihā","al-anhāru","khālidīna","fīhā","raḍiya","al-lahu","ʿanhum","waraḍū","ʿanhu","ulāika","ḥiz'bu","al-lahi","alā","inna","ḥiz'ba","al-lahi","humu","al-muf'liḥūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,450],[2,450,1120],[3,1120,2500],[4,2500,3940],[5,3940,4880],[6,4880,5880],[7,5880,6900],[8,6900,10840],[9,10840,11150],[10,11150,14669],[11,14669,15849],[12,15849,17299],[13,17299,17779],[14,17779,18849],[15,18849,19849],[16,19849,21959],[17,21959,24939],[18,24939,25329],[19,25329,28109],[20,28109,28489],[21,28489,29859],[22,29859,30209],[23,30209,32109],[24,32109,34618],[25,34618,35228],[26,35228,35558],[27,35558,36798],[28,36798,37978],[29,37978,39918],[30,39918,40778],[31,40778,41948],[32,41948,43998],[33,43998,46518],[34,46518,47318],[35,47318,47898],[36,47898,49118],[37,49118,50298],[38,50298,51518],[39,51518,52548],[40,52548,53678],[41,53678,54488],[42,54488,55328],[43,55328,56018],[44,56018,56558],[45,56558,59678],[46,59678,60238],[47,60238,63598],[48,63598,65697],[49,65697,66837],[50,66837,67527],[51,67527,68447],[52,68447,68887],[53,68887,73012]]}}
