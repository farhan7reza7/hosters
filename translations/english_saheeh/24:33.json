{"name":"24:33","price":"(33) But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allāh enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess[994] - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allāh which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allāh is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.","arabic":"وَلۡيَسۡتَعۡفِفِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَا يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحًا حَتَّىٰ يُغۡنِيَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضۡلِهِۦۗ وَٱلَّذِينَ يَبۡتَغُونَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتۡ أَيۡمَٰنُكُمۡ فَكَاتِبُوهُمۡ إِنۡ عَلِمۡتُمۡ فِيهِمۡ خَيۡرٗاۖ وَءَاتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِيٓ ءَاتَىٰكُمۡۚ وَلَا تُكۡرِهُواْ فَتَيَٰتِكُمۡ عَلَى ٱلۡبِغَآءِ إِنۡ أَرَدۡنَ تَحَصُّنٗا لِّتَبۡتَغُواْ عَرَضَ ٱلۡحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡيَاۚ وَمَن يُكۡرِههُّنَّ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ إِكۡرَٰهِهِنَّ غَفُورٞ رَّحِيمٞ","category":["24 (An-Nur)","An-Nur","Surah An-Nur","Chapter An-Nur","Nur","Surah Nur","Chapter Nur","An Nur","Surah An Nur","Chapter An Nur","Surah 24","Chapter 24","The Light","النُّور"],"ayahNumber":2824,"juzNumber":18,"footnotes":"[994]- i.e., those slaves who desire to purchase their freedom from their owners for a price agreed upon by both.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"},"meta":{"transliteration":"walyastaʿfifi alladhīna lā yajidūna nikāḥan ḥattā yugh'niyahumu al-lahu min faḍlihi wa-alladhīna yabtaghūna al-kitāba mimmā malakat aymānukum fakātibūhum in ʿalim'tum fīhim khayran waātūhum min māli al-lahi alladhī ātākum walā tuk'rihū fatayātikum ʿalā al-bighāi in aradna taḥaṣṣunan litabtaghū ʿaraḍa al-ḥayati al-dun'yā waman yuk'rihhunna fa-inna al-laha min baʿdi ik'rāhihinna ghafūrun raḥīmun ","translations":["And let be chaste","those who","(do) not","find","(means for) marriage","until","Allah enriches them","Allah enriches them","from","His Bounty","And those who","seek","the writing","from (those) whom","possess","your right hands","then give them (the) writing","if","you know","in them","any good","and give them","from","the wealth of Allah","the wealth of Allah","which","He has given you","And (do) not","compel","your slave girls","to","[the] prostitution","if","they desire","chastity","that you may seek","temporary gain","(of) the life","(of) the world","And whoever","compels them","then indeed","Allah","after","after","their compulsion","(is) Oft-Forgiving","Most Merciful","(33)"],"transliterationArr":["walyastaʿfifi","alladhīna","lā","yajidūna","nikāḥan","ḥattā","yugh'niyahumu","al-lahu","min","faḍlihi","wa-alladhīna","yabtaghūna","al-kitāba","mimmā","malakat","aymānukum","fakātibūhum","in","ʿalim'tum","fīhim","khayran","waātūhum","min","māli","al-lahi","alladhī","ātākum","walā","tuk'rihū","fatayātikum","ʿalā","al-bighāi","in","aradna","taḥaṣṣunan","litabtaghū","ʿaraḍa","al-ḥayati","al-dun'yā","waman","yuk'rihhunna","fa-inna","al-laha","min","baʿdi","ik'rāhihinna","ghafūrun","raḥīmun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1850],[2,1850,2830],[3,2830,3370],[4,3370,4330],[5,4330,5400],[6,5400,6280],[7,6280,7510],[8,7510,8530],[9,8530,9920],[10,9920,11150],[11,11150,12400],[12,12400,13620],[13,13620,14770],[14,14770,16040],[15,16040,16880],[16,16880,18290],[17,18290,20060],[18,20060,20380],[19,20380,21440],[20,21440,22330],[21,22330,23920],[22,23920,25580],[23,25580,26380],[24,26380,27740],[25,27740,28560],[26,28560,30740],[27,30740,32610],[28,32610,33240],[29,33240,34260],[30,34260,35810],[31,35810,36240],[32,36240,38900],[33,38900,39210],[34,39210,39940],[35,39940,41080],[36,41080,42470],[37,42470,43100],[38,43100,44140],[39,44140,45020],[40,45020,45770],[41,45770,47210],[42,47210,48940],[43,48940,50230],[44,50230,51170],[45,51170,52150],[46,52150,52840],[47,52840,55140],[48,55140,56030],[49,56030,58395]]}}
