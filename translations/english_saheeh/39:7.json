{"name":"39:7","price":"(7) If you disbelieve - indeed, Allāh is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves [i.e., likes] it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.","arabic":"إِن تَكۡفُرُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنكُمۡۖ وَلَا يَرۡضَىٰ لِعِبَادِهِ ٱلۡكُفۡرَۖ وَإِن تَشۡكُرُواْ يَرۡضَهُ لَكُمۡۗ وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٞ وِزۡرَ أُخۡرَىٰۚ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكُم مَّرۡجِعُكُمۡ فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمۡ تَعۡمَلُونَۚ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمُۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ","category":["39 (Az-Zumar)","Az-Zumar","Surah Az-Zumar","Chapter Az-Zumar","Zumar","Surah Zumar","Chapter Zumar","Az Zumar","Surah Az Zumar","Chapter Az Zumar","Surah 39","Chapter 39","The Troops","الزُّمَر"],"ayahNumber":4065,"juzNumber":23,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"},"meta":{"transliteration":"in takfurū fa-inna al-laha ghaniyyun ʿankum walā yarḍā liʿibādihi al-kuf'ra wa-in tashkurū yarḍahu lakum walā taziru wāziratun wiz'ra ukh'rā thumma ilā rabbikum marjiʿukum fayunabbi-ukum bimā kuntum taʿmalūna innahu ʿalīmun bidhāti al-ṣudūri ","translations":["If","you disbelieve","then indeed","Allah","(is) free from need","of you","And not","He likes","in His slaves","ungratefulness","And if","you are grateful","He likes it","in you","And not","will bear","bearer of burdens","(the) burden","(of) another","Then","to","your Lord","(is) your return","then He will inform you","about what","you used to","do","Indeed, He","(is) the All-Knower","of what (is) in the breasts","of what (is) in the breasts","(7)"],"transliterationArr":["in","takfurū","fa-inna","al-laha","ghaniyyun","ʿankum","walā","yarḍā","liʿibādihi","al-kuf'ra","wa-in","tashkurū","yarḍahu","lakum","walā","taziru","wāziratun","wiz'ra","ukh'rā","thumma","ilā","rabbikum","marjiʿukum","fayunabbi-ukum","bimā","kuntum","taʿmalūna","innahu","ʿalīmun","bidhāti","al-ṣudūri",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,820],[2,820,2560],[3,2560,3920],[4,3920,4900],[5,4900,5700],[6,5700,8440],[7,8440,9110],[8,9110,9980],[9,9980,11300],[10,11300,11980],[11,11980,14040],[12,14040,15130],[13,15130,15980],[14,15980,17080],[15,17080,17670],[16,17670,18440],[17,18440,20430],[18,20430,21000],[19,21000,22500],[20,22500,23780],[21,23780,24400],[22,24400,25390],[23,25390,27270],[24,27270,29770],[25,29770,30290],[26,30290,32040],[27,32040,35210],[28,35210,37040],[29,37040,39030],[30,39030,39930],[31,39930,43445]]}}
