{"name":"58:7","price":"(7) Have you not considered that Allāh knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth? There are not three in a private conversation but that He is the fourth of them,[1642] nor are there five but that He is the sixth of them - and no less than that and no more except that He is with them [in knowledge] wherever they are. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed Allāh is, of all things, Knowing.","arabic":"أَلَمۡ تَرَ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَعۡلَمُ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ مَا يَكُونُ مِن نَّجۡوَىٰ ثَلَٰثَةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ رَابِعُهُمۡ وَلَا خَمۡسَةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ سَادِسُهُمۡ وَلَآ أَدۡنَىٰ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَآ أَكۡثَرَ إِلَّا هُوَ مَعَهُمۡ أَيۡنَ مَا كَانُواْۖ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا عَمِلُواْ يَوۡمَ ٱلۡقِيَٰمَةِۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَيۡءٍ عَلِيمٌ","category":["58 (Al-Mujadila)","Al-Mujadila","Surah Al-Mujadila","Chapter Al-Mujadila","Mujadila","Surah Mujadila","Chapter Mujadila","Al Mujadila","Surah Al Mujadila","Chapter Al Mujadila","Surah 58","Chapter 58","The Pleading Woman","المجادلة"],"ayahNumber":5111,"juzNumber":28,"footnotes":"[1642]- Through His knowledge of them and their secrets.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"},"meta":{"transliteration":"alam tara anna al-laha yaʿlamu mā fī al-samāwāti wamā fī al-arḍi mā yakūnu min najwā thalāthatin illā huwa rābiʿuhum walā khamsatin illā huwa sādisuhum walā adnā min dhālika walā akthara illā huwa maʿahum ayna mā kānū thumma yunabbi-uhum bimā ʿamilū yawma al-qiyāmati inna al-laha bikulli shayin ʿalīmun ","translations":["Do not","you see","that","Allah","knows","whatever","(is) in","the heavens","and whatever","(is) in","the earth","Not","there is","any","secret counsel","(of) three","but","He (is)","(the) fourth of them","and not","five","but","He (is)","(the) sixth of them","and not","less","than","that","and not","more","but","He","(is) with them","wherever","wherever","they are","Then","He will inform them","of what","they did","(on the) Day","(of) the Resurrection","Indeed","Allah","of every","thing","(is) All-Knower","(7)"],"transliterationArr":["alam","tara","anna","al-laha","yaʿlamu","mā","fī","al-samāwāti","wamā","fī","al-arḍi","mā","yakūnu","min","najwā","thalāthatin","illā","huwa","rābiʿuhum","walā","khamsatin","illā","huwa","sādisuhum","walā","adnā","min","dhālika","walā","akthara","illā","huwa","maʿahum","ayna","mā","kānū","thumma","yunabbi-uhum","bimā","ʿamilū","yawma","al-qiyāmati","inna","al-laha","bikulli","shayin","ʿalīmun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,590],[2,590,1040],[3,1040,2260],[4,2260,3110],[5,3110,3920],[6,3920,4280],[7,4280,4490],[8,4490,5920],[9,5920,6520],[10,6520,6740],[11,6740,7480],[12,7480,8130],[13,8130,9150],[14,9150,9470],[15,9470,10870],[16,10870,12180],[17,12180,12960],[18,12960,13200],[19,13200,14610],[20,14610,15140],[21,15140,16220],[22,16220,17070],[23,17070,17390],[24,17390,18710],[25,18710,20880],[26,20880,21680],[27,21680,22860],[28,22860,23680],[29,23680,25410],[30,25410,26200],[31,26200,27020],[32,27020,27390],[33,27390,28210],[34,28210,28840],[35,28840,28970],[36,28970,29690],[37,29690,31850],[38,31850,33920],[39,33920,34440],[40,34440,35220],[41,35220,35820],[42,35820,37600],[43,37600,38680],[44,38680,39580],[45,39580,40340],[46,40340,41270],[47,41270,43525]]}}
