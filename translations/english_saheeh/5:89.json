{"name":"5:89","price":"(89) Allāh will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless[279] in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation[280] is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.[281] Thus does Allāh make clear to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.","arabic":"لَا يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱللَّغۡوِ فِيٓ أَيۡمَٰنِكُمۡ وَلَٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ ٱلۡأَيۡمَٰنَۖ فَكَفَّٰرَتُهُۥٓ إِطۡعَامُ عَشَرَةِ مَسَٰكِينَ مِنۡ أَوۡسَطِ مَا تُطۡعِمُونَ أَهۡلِيكُمۡ أَوۡ كِسۡوَتُهُمۡ أَوۡ تَحۡرِيرُ رَقَبَةٖۖ فَمَن لَّمۡ يَجِدۡ فَصِيَامُ ثَلَٰثَةِ أَيَّامٖۚ ذَٰلِكَ كَفَّٰرَةُ أَيۡمَٰنِكُمۡ إِذَا حَلَفۡتُمۡۚ وَٱحۡفَظُوٓاْ أَيۡمَٰنَكُمۡۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمۡ ءَايَٰتِهِۦ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تَشۡكُرُونَ","category":["5 (Al-Ma'idah)","Al-Ma'idah","Surah Al-Ma'idah","Chapter Al-Ma'idah","Ma'idah","Surah Ma'idah","Chapter Ma'idah","Al Ma'idah","Surah Al Ma'idah","Chapter Al Ma'idah","Surah 5","Chapter 5","The Table Spread","المَائدة"],"ayahNumber":758,"juzNumber":7,"footnotes":"[279]- i.e., what is sworn to only out of habit of speech or what one utters carelessly without true intent.\n[280]- i.e., that for a deliberate oath.\n[281]- i.e., do not take oaths indiscriminately or swear to do that which is sinful, requiring expiation.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_saheeh","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.1","last_update":1658318019,"title":"English Translation - Saheeh International","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English - Saheeh International - Al-Muntada Al-Islami (Islamic Forum)"},"meta":{"transliteration":"lā yuākhidhukumu al-lahu bil-laghwi fī aymānikum walākin yuākhidhukum bimā ʿaqqadttumu al-aymāna fakaffāratuhu iṭ'ʿāmu ʿasharati masākīna min awsaṭi mā tuṭ'ʿimūna ahlīkum aw kis'watuhum aw taḥrīru raqabatin faman lam yajid faṣiyāmu thalāthati ayyāmin dhālika kaffāratu aymānikum idhā ḥalaftum wa-iḥ'faẓū aymānakum kadhālika yubayyinu al-lahu lakum āyātihi laʿallakum tashkurūna ","translations":["Not","will call you to account","Allah","for the thoughtless utterances","in","your oaths","but","He will call you to account","for what","you contracted","(of) the oath","So its expiation","(is) feeding","(of) ten","needy people","of","average","(of) what","you feed","your families","or","clothing them","or","freeing","a slave","But whoever","(does) not","find","(that), then fasting","(for) three","days","That","(is the) expiation","(of) your oaths","when","you have sworn","And guard","your oaths","Thus","makes clear","Allah","to you","His Verses","so that you may","(be) grateful","(89)"],"transliterationArr":["lā","yuākhidhukumu","al-lahu","bil-laghwi","fī","aymānikum","walākin","yuākhidhukum","bimā","ʿaqqadttumu","al-aymāna","fakaffāratuhu","iṭ'ʿāmu","ʿasharati","masākīna","min","awsaṭi","mā","tuṭ'ʿimūna","ahlīkum","aw","kis'watuhum","aw","taḥrīru","raqabatin","faman","lam","yajid","faṣiyāmu","thalāthati","ayyāmin","dhālika","kaffāratu","aymānikum","idhā","ḥalaftum","wa-iḥ'faẓū","aymānakum","kadhālika","yubayyinu","al-lahu","lakum","āyātihi","laʿallakum","tashkurūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,560],[2,560,1940],[3,1940,2800],[4,2800,3850],[5,3850,5340],[6,5340,6790],[7,6790,8350],[8,8350,10230],[9,10230,10800],[10,10800,12000],[11,12000,12900],[12,12900,14360],[13,14360,17529],[14,17529,18579],[15,18579,19389],[16,19389,20649],[17,20649,21039],[18,21039,21879],[19,21879,22229],[20,22229,23469],[21,23469,24719],[22,24719,25099],[23,25099,26399],[24,26399,26719],[25,26719,27779],[26,27779,28809],[27,28809,29219],[28,29219,29799],[29,29799,30409],[30,30409,31439],[31,31439,32559],[32,32559,34658],[33,34658,35779],[34,35779,37039],[35,37039,38459],[36,38459,39009],[37,39009,40309],[38,40309,42859],[39,42859,44689],[40,44689,45669],[41,45669,46689],[42,46689,47479],[43,47479,48129],[44,48129,49609],[45,49609,50879],[46,50879,53434]]}}
