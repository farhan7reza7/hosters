Finally, he had a total of ten wives from the age of 53 until his death at the age of 63. Most of these marriages were to widows, and in some cases to foster ties with some of his companions and neighboring tribes. ‘Ā’ishah was the only virgin among all his wives.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"tur'jī man tashāu min'hunna watu'wī ilayka man tashāu wamani ib'taghayta mimman ʿazalta falā junāḥa ʿalayka dhālika adnā an taqarra aʿyunuhunna walā yaḥzanna wayarḍayna bimā ātaytahunna kulluhunna wal-lahu yaʿlamu mā fī qulūbikum wakāna al-lahu ʿalīman ḥalīman ","translations":["You may defer","whom","you will","of them","or you may take","to yourself","whom","you will","And whoever","you desire","of those whom","you (had) set aside ","then (there is) no","blame","upon you","That","(is) more suitable","that","may be cooled","their eyes","and not","they grieve","and they may be pleased","with what","you have given them ","all of them","And Allah","knows","what","(is) in","your hearts","And Allah is","And Allah is","All-Knower","Most Forbearing","(51)"],"transliterationArr":["tur'jī","man","tashāu","min'hunna","watu'wī","ilayka","man","tashāu","wamani","ib'taghayta","mimman","ʿazalta","falā","junāḥa","ʿalayka","dhālika","adnā","an","taqarra","aʿyunuhunna","walā","yaḥzanna","wayarḍayna","bimā","ātaytahunna","kulluhunna","wal-lahu","yaʿlamu","mā","fī","qulūbikum","wakāna","al-lahu","ʿalīman","ḥalīman",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,820],[2,820,1610],[3,1610,3690],[4,3690,5080],[5,5080,7400],[6,7400,8120],[7,8120,9070],[8,9070,9920],[9,9920,11890],[10,11890,12390],[11,12390,13340],[12,13340,14430],[13,14430,15250],[14,15250,15770],[15,15770,16530],[16,16530,18240],[17,18240,19430],[18,19430,21030],[19,21030,21840],[20,21840,22650],[21,22650,24370],[22,24370,24850],[23,24850,26230],[24,26230,27220],[25,27220,28880],[26,28880,30900],[27,30900,32620],[28,32620,33940],[29,33940,34700],[30,34700,35030],[31,35030,35390],[32,35390,36870],[33,36870,37550],[34,37550,38290],[35,38290,39130],[36,39130,40735]]}}
