{"name":"2:185","price":"Ramadān is a month in which the Qur’an was sent down[82] as a guidance for mankind and as clear signs that show the right way and distinguish between right and wrong. So whoever of you witnesses this month, should fast. But if anyone is ill or on a journey, he should make up for those days. Allah wants ease for you and does not want hardship for you, so that you may complete the prescribed number of days, and proclaim the greatness of Allah for having guided you, and so that you may be grateful.","arabic":"شَهۡرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِيٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلۡقُرۡءَانُ هُدٗى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَٰتٖ مِّنَ ٱلۡهُدَىٰ وَٱلۡفُرۡقَانِۚ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهۡرَ فَلۡيَصُمۡهُۖ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوۡ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٖ فَعِدَّةٞ مِّنۡ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَۗ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلۡيُسۡرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلۡعُسۡرَ وَلِتُكۡمِلُواْ ٱلۡعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُواْ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَىٰكُمۡ وَلَعَلَّكُمۡ تَشۡكُرُونَ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":192,"juzNumber":2,"footnotes":"[82] This either means that the Qur’an was sent down from the Preserved Tablet to the Lowest Heaven on the Night of Decree during the month of Ramadan, or that it was the start of the revelation to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"shahru ramaḍāna alladhī unzila fīhi al-qur'ānu hudan lilnnāsi wabayyinātin mina al-hudā wal-fur'qāni faman shahida minkumu al-shahra falyaṣum'hu waman kāna marīḍan aw ʿalā safarin faʿiddatun min ayyāmin ukhara yurīdu al-lahu bikumu al-yus'ra walā yurīdu bikumu al-ʿus'ra walituk'milū al-ʿidata walitukabbirū al-laha ʿalā mā hadākum walaʿallakum tashkurūna ","translations":["Month","(of) Ramadhaan","(is) that","was revealed","therein","the Quran","a Guidance","for mankind","and clear proofs","of","[the] Guidance","and the Criterion","So whoever","witnesses","among you","the month","then he should fast in it","and whoever","is","sick","or","on","a journey","then prescribed number (should be made up)","from","days","other","Intends","Allah","for you","[the] ease","and not","intends","for you","[the] hardship","so that you complete","the prescribed period","and that you magnify","Allah","for","[what]","He guided you","so that you may","(be) grateful","(185)"],"transliterationArr":["shahru","ramaḍāna","alladhī","unzila","fīhi","al-qur'ānu","hudan","lilnnāsi","wabayyinātin","mina","al-hudā","wal-fur'qāni","faman","shahida","minkumu","al-shahra","falyaṣum'hu","waman","kāna","marīḍan","aw","ʿalā","safarin","faʿiddatun","min","ayyāmin","ukhara","yurīdu","al-lahu","bikumu","al-yus'ra","walā","yurīdu","bikumu","al-ʿus'ra","walituk'milū","al-ʿidata","walitukabbirū","al-laha","ʿalā","mā","hadākum","walaʿallakum","tashkurūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,760],[2,760,1520],[3,1520,3570],[4,3570,4930],[5,4930,5440],[6,5440,6540],[7,6540,6990],[8,6990,8750],[9,8750,10170],[10,10170,11290],[11,11290,12100],[12,12100,14920],[13,14920,16770],[14,16770,17420],[15,17420,18660],[16,18660,19480],[17,19480,20550],[18,20550,22050],[19,22050,22590],[20,22590,23560],[21,23560,23930],[22,23930,24420],[23,24420,25650],[24,25650,26680],[25,26680,27870],[26,27870,28980],[27,28980,30150],[28,30150,30970],[29,30970,31720],[30,31720,32230],[31,32230,33070],[32,33070,33560],[33,33560,34330],[34,34330,34820],[35,34820,35670],[36,35670,36650],[37,36650,37630],[38,37630,39050],[39,39050,42120],[40,42120,43380],[41,43380,44100],[42,44100,44730],[43,44730,45110],[44,45110,46130],[45,46130,47440],[46,47440,49885]]}}
