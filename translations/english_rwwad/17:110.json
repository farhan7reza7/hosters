When he used to lead his Companions in Prayer and raise his voice and the pagans heard him, they would curse the Qur’an and He Who sent it down. So Allah said to His Messenger: “Do not raise your voice is Prayer upon which the pagans would hear you, yet not too quiet that your Companions may not hear you. Make them hear the Qur’an but do not raise your voice to that extent; seeking a middle way between them.” [Al-Bukhārī: 4722; Muslim: 446].","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"quli id'ʿū al-laha awi id'ʿū al-raḥmāna ayyan mā tadʿū falahu al-asmāu al-ḥus'nā walā tajhar biṣalātika walā tukhāfit bihā wa-ib'taghi bayna dhālika sabīlan ","translations":["Say","Invoke","Allah","or","invoke","the Most Gracious","By whatever (name)","By whatever (name)","you invoke","to Him (belongs)","the Most Beautiful Names","the Most Beautiful Names","And (do) not","be loud","in your prayers","and not","be silent","therein","but seek","between","that","a way","(110)"],"transliterationArr":["quli","id'ʿū","al-laha","awi","id'ʿū","al-raḥmāna","ayyan","mā","tadʿū","falahu","al-asmāu","al-ḥus'nā","walā","tajhar","biṣalātika","walā","tukhāfit","bihā","wa-ib'taghi","bayna","dhālika","sabīlan",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,420],[2,420,750],[3,750,1690],[4,1690,2120],[5,2120,2540],[6,2540,5620],[7,5620,6290],[8,6290,7300],[9,7300,8150],[10,8150,8810],[11,8810,11400],[12,11400,12560],[13,12560,13460],[14,13460,14380],[15,14380,15680],[16,15680,16310],[17,16310,17390],[18,17390,18020],[19,18020,18910],[20,18910,19520],[21,19520,20380],[22,20380,21925]]}}
