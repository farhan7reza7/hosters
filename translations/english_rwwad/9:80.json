As He (ﷺ) stood up, I sprang to him and said: “Messenger of Allah, will you pray over Ibn ’Ubayy, in spite of him saying so and so on the day of so and so!” I recounted to him (ﷺ) what he said. The Messenger (ﷺ) smiled and said: “Move away from me ‘Umar.” When I had argued a great deal with him, he said: “I was given a choice and I made my choice. Had I known that if I were to seek forgiveness for him more than seventy times he would be forgiven, I would have sought it more!” The Messenger (ﷺ) prayed and then left. It was just a short while after that the two verses in Barā’ah (al-Tawbah) came down: “Do not ever pray over anyone of them who dies … died while in a state of contravention”…” [Al-Bukhārī: 1366].","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"is'taghfir lahum aw lā tastaghfir lahum in tastaghfir lahum sabʿīna marratan falan yaghfira al-lahu lahum dhālika bi-annahum kafarū bil-lahi warasūlihi wal-lahu lā yahdī al-qawma al-fāsiqīna ","translations":["Ask forgiveness","for them","or","(do) not","ask forgiveness","for them","If","you ask forgiveness","for them","seventy","times","never","will Allah forgive","will Allah forgive","[for] them","That","(is) because they","disbelieved","in Allah","and His Messenger","and Allah","(does) not","guide","the people","the defiantly disobedient","(80)"],"transliterationArr":["is'taghfir","lahum","aw","lā","tastaghfir","lahum","in","tastaghfir","lahum","sabʿīna","marratan","falan","yaghfira","al-lahu","lahum","dhālika","bi-annahum","kafarū","bil-lahi","warasūlihi","wal-lahu","lā","yahdī","al-qawma","al-fāsiqīna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1270],[2,1270,2070],[3,2070,2460],[4,2460,2910],[5,2910,4200],[6,4200,4910],[7,4910,6190],[8,6190,7430],[9,7430,8150],[10,8150,9290],[11,9290,11130],[12,11130,11730],[13,11730,13370],[14,13370,14240],[15,14240,15510],[16,15510,16420],[17,16420,18440],[18,18440,19350],[19,19350,20520],[20,20520,22300],[21,22300,23370],[22,23370,23860],[23,23860,24560],[24,24560,25430],[25,25430,29615]]}}
