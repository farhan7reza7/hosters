{"name":"6:136","price":"They assign to Allah a portion of the crops and livestock He created, saying, “This is for Allah” – as they claim – “and this is for our partners [i.e., idols].” But that which is assigned for their partners does not reach Allah, while that which is assigned for Allah reaches their partners[44].

If a portion of God’s share was mixed with that of their idols, they would not deduct it, saying that God is in no need of it. Yet if a portion of their idols’ share fell with that of God’s they would readily cut it and add it on to their idols’ share.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wajaʿalū lillahi mimmā dhara-a mina al-ḥarthi wal-anʿāmi naṣīban faqālū hādhā lillahi bizaʿmihim wahādhā lishurakāinā famā kāna lishurakāihim falā yaṣilu ilā al-lahi wamā kāna lillahi fahuwa yaṣilu ilā shurakāihim sāa mā yaḥkumūna ","translations":["And they assign","to Allah","out of what","He produced","of","the crops","and the cattle","a share","and they say","This","(is) for Allah","by their claim","And this","(is) for our partners","But what","is","for their partners","(does) not","reach","[to]","Allah","while what","is","for Allah","then it","reaches","[to]","their partners","Evil","(is) what","they judge","(136)"],"transliterationArr":["wajaʿalū","lillahi","mimmā","dhara-a","mina","al-ḥarthi","wal-anʿāmi","naṣīban","faqālū","hādhā","lillahi","bizaʿmihim","wahādhā","lishurakāinā","famā","kāna","lishurakāihim","falā","yaṣilu","ilā","al-lahi","wamā","kāna","lillahi","fahuwa","yaṣilu","ilā","shurakāihim","sāa","mā","yaḥkumūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1140],[2,1140,2160],[3,2160,3790],[4,3790,4400],[5,4400,4680],[6,4680,5540],[7,5540,6900],[8,6900,8490],[9,8490,9560],[10,9560,10320],[11,10320,11390],[12,11390,12530],[13,12530,13520],[14,13520,16890],[15,16890,18070],[16,18070,18720],[17,18720,21620],[18,21620,22250],[19,22250,22870],[20,22870,23210],[21,23210,25680],[22,25680,26250],[23,26250,26880],[24,26880,27960],[25,27960,28490],[26,28490,29170],[27,29170,29700],[28,29700,32810],[29,32810,35280],[30,35280,35670],[31,35670,38445]]}}
