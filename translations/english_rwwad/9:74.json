They are spiteful [against believers] for no reason except that Allah and His Messenger have enriched them out of His bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will chastise them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have on earth no protector or helper.","arabic":"يَحۡلِفُونَ بِٱللَّهِ مَا قَالُواْ وَلَقَدۡ قَالُواْ كَلِمَةَ ٱلۡكُفۡرِ وَكَفَرُواْ بَعۡدَ إِسۡلَٰمِهِمۡ وَهَمُّواْ بِمَا لَمۡ يَنَالُواْۚ وَمَا نَقَمُوٓاْ إِلَّآ أَنۡ أَغۡنَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ مِن فَضۡلِهِۦۚ فَإِن يَتُوبُواْ يَكُ خَيۡرٗا لَّهُمۡۖ وَإِن يَتَوَلَّوۡاْ يُعَذِّبۡهُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَذَابًا أَلِيمٗا فِي ٱلدُّنۡيَا وَٱلۡأٓخِرَةِۚ وَمَا لَهُمۡ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ مِن وَلِيّٖ وَلَا نَصِيرٖ","category":["9 (At-Tawbah)","At-Tawbah","Surah At-Tawbah","Chapter At-Tawbah","Tawbah","Surah Tawbah","Chapter Tawbah","At Tawbah","Surah At Tawbah","Chapter At Tawbah","Surah 9","Chapter 9","The Repentance","التوبَة"],"ayahNumber":1309,"juzNumber":10,"footnotes":"[61] such as insulting the Messenger (ﷺ) and attacking the religion.\n [62] They devised to assassinate the Prophet (ﷺ) upon his return from the Tabuk Expedition, but their plot was foiled.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"yaḥlifūna bil-lahi mā qālū walaqad qālū kalimata al-kuf'ri wakafarū baʿda is'lāmihim wahammū bimā lam yanālū wamā naqamū illā an aghnāhumu al-lahu warasūluhu min faḍlihi fa-in yatūbū yaku khayran lahum wa-in yatawallaw yuʿadhib'humu al-lahu ʿadhāban alīman fī al-dun'yā wal-ākhirati wamā lahum fī al-arḍi min waliyyin walā naṣīrin ","translations":["They swear","by Allah","(that) they said nothing","(that) they said nothing","while certainly","they said","(the) word","(of) the disbelief","and disbelieved","after","their (pretense of) Islam","and planned","[of] what","not","they could attain","And not","they were resentful","except","that","Allah had enriched them","Allah had enriched them","and His Messenger","of","His Bounty","So if","they repent","it is","better","for them","and if","they turn away","Allah will punish them","Allah will punish them","(with) a punishment","painful","in","the world","and (in) the Hereafter","And not","for them","in","the earth","any","protector","and not","a helper","(74)"],"transliterationArr":["yaḥlifūna","bil-lahi","mā","qālū","walaqad","qālū","kalimata","al-kuf'ri","wakafarū","baʿda","is'lāmihim","wahammū","bimā","lam","yanālū","wamā","naqamū","illā","an","aghnāhumu","al-lahu","warasūluhu","min","faḍlihi","fa-in","yatūbū","yaku","khayran","lahum","wa-in","yatawallaw","yuʿadhib'humu","al-lahu","ʿadhāban","alīman","fī","al-dun'yā","wal-ākhirati","wamā","lahum","fī","al-arḍi","min","waliyyin","walā","naṣīrin",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1420],[2,1420,2570],[3,2570,2940],[4,2940,4000],[5,4000,4730],[6,4730,5710],[7,5710,6630],[8,6630,7500],[9,7500,8640],[10,8640,9280],[11,9280,10890],[12,10890,12940],[13,12940,13710],[14,13710,14100],[15,14100,15440],[16,15440,16720],[17,16720,18800],[18,18800,20250],[19,20250,21480],[20,21480,21910],[21,21910,23220],[22,23220,24240],[23,24240,25770],[24,25770,26280],[25,26280,28590],[26,28590,29730],[27,29730,30940],[28,30940,31460],[29,31460,32140],[30,32140,33470],[31,33470,34830],[32,34830,36130],[33,36130,37660],[34,37660,38620],[35,38620,39780],[36,39780,41670],[37,41670,41930],[38,41930,43130],[39,43130,45180],[40,45180,45840],[41,45840,46470],[42,46470,46740],[43,46740,47660],[44,47660,48660],[45,48660,50460],[46,50460,51100],[47,51100,53895]]}}
