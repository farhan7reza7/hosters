However, flaws or mistakes could happen with prophets, like all other human beings. The examples include the Prophet’s response to the blind man (80:1-10); Jonah’s departure from his people without Allah’s permission (21:87-88); and David’s suspicion and fear of the two men who scaled the wall of his chamber (38:21-25). If the Prophet (ﷺ) himself is urged to seek Allah’s forgiveness, then the believers are far more in need of seeking Allah’s forgiveness.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"fa-iṣ'bir inna waʿda al-lahi ḥaqqun wa-is'taghfir lidhanbika wasabbiḥ biḥamdi rabbika bil-ʿashiyi wal-ib'kāri ","translations":["So be patient","indeed","(the) Promise of Allah","(the) Promise of Allah","(is) true","And ask forgiveness","for your sin","and glorify","(the) praise","(of) your Lord","in the evening","and the morning","(55)"],"transliterationArr":["fa-iṣ'bir","inna","waʿda","al-lahi","ḥaqqun","wa-is'taghfir","lidhanbika","wasabbiḥ","biḥamdi","rabbika","bil-ʿashiyi","wal-ib'kāri",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,830],[2,830,1900],[3,1900,2430],[4,2430,3260],[5,3260,4520],[6,4520,5620],[7,5620,7170],[8,7170,8080],[9,8080,8820],[10,8820,9630],[11,9630,10820],[12,10820,13975]]}}
