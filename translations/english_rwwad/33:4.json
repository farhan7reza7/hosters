If someone declared his wife as unlawful for him as the zahr (back) of his mother is unlawful for him, his wife would be divorced. Islam abolished this divorce. Allah says: “As for those among you who divorce their wives by likening them to their mothers, they are not their mothers; their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them.” See 58:2.\n [2] Adoption of a child or an orphan is not permissible by ascribing the child to other than their real parents. Whereas, it is permissible for one to sponsor a child or host them in their home and care for them as they care for their own children, except for legal matters.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"mā jaʿala al-lahu lirajulin min qalbayni fī jawfihi wamā jaʿala azwājakumu allāī tuẓāhirūna min'hunna ummahātikum wamā jaʿala adʿiyāakum abnāakum dhālikum qawlukum bi-afwāhikum wal-lahu yaqūlu al-ḥaqa wahuwa yahdī al-sabīla ","translations":["Not","Allah (has) made","Allah (has) made","for any man","[of]","two hearts","in","his interior","And not","He (has) made","your wives","whom","you declare unlawful","[of them]","(as) your mothers","And not","He has made","your adopted sons","your sons","That","(is) your saying","by your mouths","but Allah","says","the truth","and He","guides","(to) the Way","(4)"],"transliterationArr":["mā","jaʿala","al-lahu","lirajulin","min","qalbayni","fī","jawfihi","wamā","jaʿala","azwājakumu","allāī","tuẓāhirūna","min'hunna","ummahātikum","wamā","jaʿala","adʿiyāakum","abnāakum","dhālikum","qawlukum","bi-afwāhikum","wal-lahu","yaqūlu","al-ḥaqa","wahuwa","yahdī","al-sabīla",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,400],[2,400,930],[3,930,1850],[4,1850,2690],[5,2690,4670],[6,4670,5590],[7,5590,6020],[8,6020,7180],[9,7180,7720],[10,7720,8410],[11,8410,9720],[12,9720,12090],[13,12090,13490],[14,13490,15100],[15,15100,17670],[16,17670,18250],[17,18250,18930],[18,18930,22070],[19,22070,25030],[20,25030,26000],[21,26000,27580],[22,27580,29410],[23,29410,30370],[24,30370,31190],[25,31190,32000],[26,32000,32470],[27,32470,33120],[28,33120,36025]]}}
