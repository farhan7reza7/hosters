{"name":"4:171","price":"O People of the Book, do not go to extremes in your religion, and do not say about Allah but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His Word that He bestowed upon Mary, and a spirit[110] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say “Three” [i.e., Trinity]. Cease; that is better for you. Indeed, Allah is the only One God. Glory be to Him, [far exalted is He] to have a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and sufficient is Allah as a Disposer of Affairs.","arabic":"يَٰٓأَهۡلَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ لَا تَغۡلُواْ فِي دِينِكُمۡ وَلَا تَقُولُواْ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ إِلَّا ٱلۡحَقَّۚ إِنَّمَا ٱلۡمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ٱبۡنُ مَرۡيَمَ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُۥٓ أَلۡقَىٰهَآ إِلَىٰ مَرۡيَمَ وَرُوحٞ مِّنۡهُۖ فَـَٔامِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦۖ وَلَا تَقُولُواْ ثَلَٰثَةٌۚ ٱنتَهُواْ خَيۡرٗا لَّكُمۡۚ إِنَّمَا ٱللَّهُ إِلَٰهٞ وَٰحِدٞۖ سُبۡحَٰنَهُۥٓ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٞۘ لَّهُۥ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ وَكِيلٗا","category":["4 (An-Nisa)","An-Nisa","Surah An-Nisa","Chapter An-Nisa","Nisa","Surah Nisa","Chapter Nisa","An Nisa","Surah An Nisa","Chapter An Nisa","Surah 4","Chapter 4","The Women","النِّسَاء"],"ayahNumber":664,"juzNumber":6,"footnotes":"[110] That is, Jesus’s spirit was created by Allah. [Ibn Kathīr, al-Sa‘dī]. Al-Baghawī says: “He (Jesus) is a soul just like any other soul but Allah added him to Himself to honor him”. Al-Shawkānī is also of this opinion. Al-Alūsī says: “Because Jesus was created by a blow (of air), not by a drop (of sperm), he was called a ‘soul’.” The Qur’an makes it clear that Jesus is just like all other human beings, whose spirit was created by Allah.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"yāahla al-kitābi lā taghlū fī dīnikum walā taqūlū ʿalā al-lahi illā al-ḥaqa innamā al-masīḥu ʿīsā ub'nu maryama rasūlu al-lahi wakalimatuhu alqāhā ilā maryama warūḥun min'hu faāminū bil-lahi warusulihi walā taqūlū thalāthatun intahū khayran lakum innamā al-lahu ilāhun wāḥidun sub'ḥānahu an yakūna lahu waladun lahu mā fī al-samāwāti wamā fī al-arḍi wakafā bil-lahi wakīlan ","translations":["O People","(of) the Book","(Do) not","commit excess","in","your religion","and (do) not","say","about","Allah","except","the truth","Only","the Messiah","Isa","son","(of) Maryam","(was) a Messenger","(of) Allah","and His word","which He conveyed","to","Maryam","and a spirit","from Him","So believe","in Allah","and His Messengers","And (do) not","say","Three","desist","(it is) better","for you","Only","Allah","(is) God","One","Glory be to Him","That","He (should) have","for Him","a son","To Him (belongs)","whatever","(is) in","the heavens","and whatever","(is) in","the earth","And is sufficient","Allah","(as) a Disposer of affairs","(171)"],"transliterationArr":["yāahla","al-kitābi","lā","taghlū","fī","dīnikum","walā","taqūlū","ʿalā","al-lahi","illā","al-ḥaqa","innamā","al-masīḥu","ʿīsā","ub'nu","maryama","rasūlu","al-lahi","wakalimatuhu","alqāhā","ilā","maryama","warūḥun","min'hu","faāminū","bil-lahi","warusulihi","walā","taqūlū","thalāthatun","intahū","khayran","lakum","innamā","al-lahu","ilāhun","wāḥidun","sub'ḥānahu","an","yakūna","lahu","waladun","lahu","mā","fī","al-samāwāti","wamā","fī","al-arḍi","wakafā","bil-lahi","wakīlan",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,2380],[2,2380,3440],[3,3440,3800],[4,3800,4580],[5,4580,5060],[6,5060,6110],[7,6110,6680],[8,6680,7710],[9,7710,8060],[10,8060,8940],[11,8940,9480],[12,9480,10700],[13,10700,12030],[14,12030,13110],[15,13110,13630],[16,13630,14120],[17,14120,14890],[18,14890,15700],[19,15700,16570],[20,16570,18850],[21,18850,19750],[22,19750,21350],[23,21350,21950],[24,21950,22730],[25,22730,23600],[26,23600,24640],[27,24640,26370],[28,26370,27490],[29,27490,28780],[30,28780,29390],[31,29390,30430],[32,30430,31950],[33,31950,33240],[34,33240,34180],[35,34180,35420],[36,35420,36560],[37,36560,37490],[38,37490,39320],[39,39320,40090],[40,40090,42960],[41,42960,43240],[42,43240,44060],[43,44060,44860],[44,44860,45470],[45,45470,45970],[46,45970,46910],[47,46910,47310],[48,47310,47510],[49,47510,48980],[50,48980,49560],[51,49560,49770],[52,49770,50830],[53,50830,51620],[54,51620,52640],[55,52640,54065]]}}
