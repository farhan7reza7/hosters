{"name":"2:228","price":"Divorced women should wait for three menstrual cycles[118]. It is not permissible for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs[119] if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their husbands have the greater right to take them back within that period[120] if they want reconciliation. Women have rights similar to the rights over them in a reasonable manner, although men have a higher degree [of responsibility] over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.","arabic":"وَٱلۡمُطَلَّقَٰتُ يَتَرَبَّصۡنَ بِأَنفُسِهِنَّ ثَلَٰثَةَ قُرُوٓءٖۚ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَهُنَّ أَن يَكۡتُمۡنَ مَا خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَرۡحَامِهِنَّ إِن كُنَّ يُؤۡمِنَّ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلۡيَوۡمِ ٱلۡأٓخِرِۚ وَبُعُولَتُهُنَّ أَحَقُّ بِرَدِّهِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ إِنۡ أَرَادُوٓاْ إِصۡلَٰحٗاۚ وَلَهُنَّ مِثۡلُ ٱلَّذِي عَلَيۡهِنَّ بِٱلۡمَعۡرُوفِۚ وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيۡهِنَّ دَرَجَةٞۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":235,"juzNumber":2,"footnotes":"[118] Either menstrual periods or periods of purity between menstruation; to ensure that no pregnancy has taken place.\n [119] That is to conceal pregnancy during their waiting period (‘iddah), with the intention of concluding the divorce.\n [120] During the ‘iddah period of a first and second divorce without a new marriage contract.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_rwwad","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.0.15","last_update":1711763763,"title":"English Translation - Rowwad Translation Center","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into Englsih by Rowwad Translation Center in cooperation with Islamhouse.com"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wal-muṭalaqātu yatarabbaṣna bi-anfusihinna thalāthata qurūin walā yaḥillu lahunna an yaktum'na mā khalaqa al-lahu fī arḥāmihinna in kunna yu'minna bil-lahi wal-yawmi al-ākhiri wabuʿūlatuhunna aḥaqqu biraddihinna fī dhālika in arādū iṣ'lāḥan walahunna mith'lu alladhī ʿalayhinna bil-maʿrūfi walilrrijāli ʿalayhinna darajatun wal-lahu ʿazīzun ḥakīmun ","translations":["And the women who are divorced","shall wait","concerning themselves","(for) three","monthly periods","And (it is) not","lawful","for them","that","they conceal","what","(has been) created","(by) Allah","in","their wombs","if","they","believe","in Allah","and the Day","[the] Last","And their husbands","(have) better right","to take them back","in","that (period)","if","they wish","(for) reconciliation","And for them","(is the) like","(of) that which","(is) on them","in a reasonable manner","and for the men","over them","(is) a degree","And Allah","(is) All-Mighty","All-Wise","(228)"],"transliterationArr":["wal-muṭalaqātu","yatarabbaṣna","bi-anfusihinna","thalāthata","qurūin","walā","yaḥillu","lahunna","an","yaktum'na","mā","khalaqa","al-lahu","fī","arḥāmihinna","in","kunna","yu'minna","bil-lahi","wal-yawmi","al-ākhiri","wabuʿūlatuhunna","aḥaqqu","biraddihinna","fī","dhālika","in","arādū","iṣ'lāḥan","walahunna","mith'lu","alladhī","ʿalayhinna","bil-maʿrūfi","walilrrijāli","ʿalayhinna","darajatun","wal-lahu","ʿazīzun","ḥakīmun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1710],[2,1710,3030],[3,3030,5570],[4,5570,6570],[5,6570,8790],[6,8790,9320],[7,9320,10060],[8,10060,11290],[9,11290,11700],[10,11700,13050],[11,13050,13440],[12,13440,14030],[13,14030,14730],[14,14730,16090],[15,16090,18160],[16,18160,19170],[17,19170,20330],[18,20330,21880],[19,21880,22860],[20,22860,23810],[21,23810,24670],[22,24670,27400],[23,27400,28200],[24,28200,29940],[25,29940,30360],[26,30360,31080],[27,31080,31440],[28,31440,33510],[29,33510,34860],[30,34860,36650],[31,36650,37130],[32,37130,37890],[33,37890,39410],[34,39410,41679],[35,41679,43320],[36,43320,44980],[37,44980,46130],[38,46130,47050],[39,47050,47980],[40,47980,50005]]}}
