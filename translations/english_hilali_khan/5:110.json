{"name":"5:110","price":" 110. (Remember) when Allâh will say (on the Day of Resurrection). \"O ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Remember My Favour to you and to your mother when I supported you with Rûh-ul-Qudus [Jibrîl (Gabriel)] so that you spoke to the people in the cradle[1] and in maturity; and when I taught you writing, Al-Hikmah (the power of understanding), the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel); and when you made out of the clay a figure like that of a bird, by My Permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My Permission, and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My Permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My Permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you (when they resolved to kill you) as you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said: ‘This is nothing but evident magic.’\"","arabic":"إِذۡ قَالَ ٱللَّهُ يَٰعِيسَى ٱبۡنَ مَرۡيَمَ ٱذۡكُرۡ نِعۡمَتِي عَلَيۡكَ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَتِكَ إِذۡ أَيَّدتُّكَ بِرُوحِ ٱلۡقُدُسِ تُكَلِّمُ ٱلنَّاسَ فِي ٱلۡمَهۡدِ وَكَهۡلٗاۖ وَإِذۡ عَلَّمۡتُكَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ وَٱلۡحِكۡمَةَ وَٱلتَّوۡرَىٰةَ وَٱلۡإِنجِيلَۖ وَإِذۡ تَخۡلُقُ مِنَ ٱلطِّينِ كَهَيۡـَٔةِ ٱلطَّيۡرِ بِإِذۡنِي فَتَنفُخُ فِيهَا فَتَكُونُ طَيۡرَۢا بِإِذۡنِيۖ وَتُبۡرِئُ ٱلۡأَكۡمَهَ وَٱلۡأَبۡرَصَ بِإِذۡنِيۖ وَإِذۡ تُخۡرِجُ ٱلۡمَوۡتَىٰ بِإِذۡنِيۖ وَإِذۡ كَفَفۡتُ بَنِيٓ إِسۡرَٰٓءِيلَ عَنكَ إِذۡ جِئۡتَهُم بِٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتِ فَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنۡهُمۡ إِنۡ هَٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحۡرٞ مُّبِينٞ","category":["5 (Al-Ma'idah)","Al-Ma'idah","Surah Al-Ma'idah","Chapter Al-Ma'idah","Ma'idah","Surah Ma'idah","Chapter Ma'idah","Al Ma'idah","Surah Al Ma'idah","Chapter Al Ma'idah","Surah 5","Chapter 5","The Table Spread","المَائدة"],"ayahNumber":779,"juzNumber":7,"footnotes":"(V.5:110) See the footnote (V.3:46).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"idh qāla al-lahu yāʿīsā ib'na maryama udh'kur niʿ'matī ʿalayka waʿalā wālidatika idh ayyadttuka birūḥi al-qudusi tukallimu al-nāsa fī al-mahdi wakahlan wa-idh ʿallamtuka al-kitāba wal-ḥik'mata wal-tawrāta wal-injīla wa-idh takhluqu mina al-ṭīni kahayati al-ṭayri bi-idh'nī fatanfukhu fīhā fatakūnu ṭayran bi-idh'nī watub'ri-u al-akmaha wal-abraṣa bi-idh'nī wa-idh tukh'riju al-mawtā bi-idh'nī wa-idh kafaftu banī is'rāīla ʿanka idh ji'tahum bil-bayināti faqāla alladhīna kafarū min'hum in hādhā illā siḥ'run mubīnun ","translations":["When","said","Allah","O Isa","son","(of) Maryam","Remember","My Favor","upon you","and upon","your mother","when","I strengthened you","with (the) Spirit","the Holy","you spoke","(to) the people","in","the cradle","and (in) maturity","And when","I taught you","the Book","and the wisdom","and the Taurat","and the Injeel","and when","you make","from","the clay","like the shape","(of) the bird","by My permission","then you breath","into it","and it becomes","a bird","by My permission","and you heal","the born blind","and the leper","by My permission","and when","you bring forth","the dead","by My permission","And when","I restrained","(the) Children","(of) Israel","from you","when","you came to them","with the clear proofs","then said","those who","disbelieved","among them","Not","(is) this","but","magic","clear","(110)"],"transliterationArr":["idh","qāla","al-lahu","yāʿīsā","ib'na","maryama","udh'kur","niʿ'matī","ʿalayka","waʿalā","wālidatika","idh","ayyadttuka","birūḥi","al-qudusi","tukallimu","al-nāsa","fī","al-mahdi","wakahlan","wa-idh","ʿallamtuka","al-kitāba","wal-ḥik'mata","wal-tawrāta","wal-injīla","wa-idh","takhluqu","mina","al-ṭīni","kahayati","al-ṭayri","bi-idh'nī","fatanfukhu","fīhā","fatakūnu","ṭayran","bi-idh'nī","watub'ri-u","al-akmaha","wal-abraṣa","bi-idh'nī","wa-idh","tukh'riju","al-mawtā","bi-idh'nī","wa-idh","kafaftu","banī","is'rāīla","ʿanka","idh","ji'tahum","bil-bayināti","faqāla","alladhīna","kafarū","min'hum","in","hādhā","illā","siḥ'run","mubīnun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,670],[2,670,1190],[3,1190,2140],[4,2140,3180],[5,3180,3670],[6,3670,4390],[7,4390,5100],[8,5100,6140],[9,6140,7040],[10,7040,7860],[11,7860,9120],[12,9120,9540],[13,9540,10770],[14,10770,11560],[15,11560,12450],[16,12450,13370],[17,13370,14570],[18,14570,15400],[19,15400,16260],[20,16260,17250],[21,17250,18570],[22,18570,18770],[23,18770,19640],[24,19640,20790],[25,20790,21840],[26,21840,23140],[27,23140,24240],[28,24240,25540],[29,25540,27040],[30,27040,29090],[31,29090,30850],[32,30850,31390],[33,31390,32260],[34,32260,32590],[35,32590,33560],[36,33560,34650],[37,34650,35480],[38,35480,36460],[39,36460,38020],[40,38020,38820],[41,38820,39910],[42,39910,41300],[43,41300,42870],[44,42870,43820],[45,43820,44980],[46,44980,46160],[47,46160,47130],[48,47130,47710],[49,47710,48540],[50,48540,49610],[51,49610,51220],[52,51220,51870],[53,51870,52770],[54,52770,54380],[55,54380,57250],[56,57250,58460],[57,58460,58840],[58,58840,60410],[59,60410,62050],[60,62050,62770],[61,62770,63960],[62,63960,64880],[63,64880,66170],[64,66170,67180],[65,67180,68040],[66,68040,68910],[67,68910,69270],[68,69270,71060],[69,71060,71850],[70,71850,72510],[71,72510,75445]]}}
