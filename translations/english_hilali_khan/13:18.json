{"name":"13:18","price":" 18. For those who answered their Lord’s Call [believed in the Oneness of Allâh and followed His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم i.e. Islâmic Monotheism] is Al-Husnâ (i.e. Paradise). But those who answered not His Call (disbelieved in the Oneness of Allâh and followed not His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), if they had all that is in the earth together with its like, they would offer it in order to save themselves (from the torment, but it will be in vain). For them there will be the terrible reckoning. Their dwelling-place will be Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.[2]","arabic":"لِلَّذِينَ ٱسۡتَجَابُواْ لِرَبِّهِمُ ٱلۡحُسۡنَىٰۚ وَٱلَّذِينَ لَمۡ يَسۡتَجِيبُواْ لَهُۥ لَوۡ أَنَّ لَهُم مَّا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ جَمِيعٗا وَمِثۡلَهُۥ مَعَهُۥ لَٱفۡتَدَوۡاْ بِهِۦٓۚ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمۡ سُوٓءُ ٱلۡحِسَابِ وَمَأۡوَىٰهُمۡ جَهَنَّمُۖ وَبِئۡسَ ٱلۡمِهَادُ","category":["13 (Ar-Ra'd)","Ar-Ra'd","Surah Ar-Ra'd","Chapter Ar-Ra'd","Ra'd","Surah Ra'd","Chapter Ra'd","Ar Ra'd","Surah Ar Ra'd","Chapter Ar Ra'd","Surah 13","Chapter 13","The Thunder","الرَّعد"],"ayahNumber":1725,"juzNumber":13,"footnotes":"(V.13:18) See the footnotes of (V.3:164), (V.3:85) and (V.3:91).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"lilladhīna is'tajābū lirabbihimu al-ḥus'nā wa-alladhīna lam yastajībū lahu law anna lahum mā fī al-arḍi jamīʿan wamith'lahu maʿahu la-if'tadaw bihi ulāika lahum sūu al-ḥisābi wamawāhum jahannamu wabi'sa al-mihādu ","translations":["For those who","responded","to their Lord","(is) the bliss","And for those who","(did) not","respond","to Him","if","that","they had","whatever","(is) in","the earth","all","and like of it","with it","surely they would offer ransom","with it","Those","for them","(is) a terrible","reckoning","and their abode","(is) Hell","and wretched","(is) the resting place","(18)"],"transliterationArr":["lilladhīna","is'tajābū","lirabbihimu","al-ḥus'nā","wa-alladhīna","lam","yastajībū","lahu","law","anna","lahum","mā","fī","al-arḍi","jamīʿan","wamith'lahu","maʿahu","la-if'tadaw","bihi","ulāika","lahum","sūu","al-ḥisābi","wamawāhum","jahannamu","wabi'sa","al-mihādu",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1280],[2,1280,2710],[3,2710,4030],[4,4030,5330],[5,5330,6950],[6,6950,7430],[7,7430,8980],[8,8980,9640],[9,9640,10140],[10,10140,11400],[11,11400,11990],[12,11990,12940],[13,12940,13190],[14,13190,14090],[15,14090,15300],[16,15300,16850],[17,16850,17790],[18,17790,18930],[19,18930,19880],[20,19880,22269],[21,22269,22809],[22,22809,24369],[23,24369,25669],[24,25669,27239],[25,27239,29259],[26,29259,31309],[27,31309,33469],[28,33469,34299],[29,34299,38064]]}}
