{"name":"5:48","price":" 48. And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’ân) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)[2]. So judge among them by what Allâh has revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you. To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way. If Allâh had willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so compete in good deeds. The return of you (all) is to Allâh; then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ.","arabic":"وَأَنزَلۡنَآ إِلَيۡكَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ بِٱلۡحَقِّ مُصَدِّقٗا لِّمَا بَيۡنَ يَدَيۡهِ مِنَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ وَمُهَيۡمِنًا عَلَيۡهِۖ فَٱحۡكُم بَيۡنَهُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعۡ أَهۡوَآءَهُمۡ عَمَّا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلۡحَقِّۚ لِكُلّٖ جَعَلۡنَا مِنكُمۡ شِرۡعَةٗ وَمِنۡهَاجٗاۚ وَلَوۡ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ لَجَعَلَكُمۡ أُمَّةٗ وَٰحِدَةٗ وَلَٰكِن لِّيَبۡلُوَكُمۡ فِي مَآ ءَاتَىٰكُمۡۖ فَٱسۡتَبِقُواْ ٱلۡخَيۡرَٰتِۚ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرۡجِعُكُمۡ جَمِيعٗا فَيُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمۡ فِيهِ تَخۡتَلِفُونَ","category":["5 (Al-Ma'idah)","Al-Ma'idah","Surah Al-Ma'idah","Chapter Al-Ma'idah","Ma'idah","Surah Ma'idah","Chapter Ma'idah","Al Ma'idah","Surah Al Ma'idah","Chapter Al Ma'idah","Surah 5","Chapter 5","The Table Spread","المَائدة"],"ayahNumber":717,"juzNumber":6,"footnotes":" (V.5:48) Muhaimin: that which testifies the truth that is therein and falsifies the falsehood that is added therein.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wa-anzalnā ilayka al-kitāba bil-ḥaqi muṣaddiqan limā bayna yadayhi mina al-kitābi wamuhayminan ʿalayhi fa-uḥ'kum baynahum bimā anzala al-lahu walā tattabiʿ ahwāahum ʿammā jāaka mina al-ḥaqi likullin jaʿalnā minkum shir'ʿatan wamin'hājan walaw shāa al-lahu lajaʿalakum ummatan wāḥidatan walākin liyabluwakum fī mā ātākum fa-is'tabiqū al-khayrāti ilā al-lahi marjiʿukum jamīʿan fayunabbi-ukum bimā kuntum fīhi takhtalifūna ","translations":["And We revealed","to you","the Book","in [the] truth","confirming","what","(was) before","his hands","of","the Book","and a guardian","over it","So judge","between them","by what","has revealed","Allah","and (do) not","follow","their vain desires","when","has come to you","of","the truth","For each","We have made","for you","a law","and a clear way","And if","(had) willed","Allah","He (would have) made you","a community","one","[and] but","to test you","in","what","He (has) given you","so race","(to) the good","To","Allah","you will return","all","then He will inform you","of what","you were","concerning it","differing","(48)"],"transliterationArr":["wa-anzalnā","ilayka","al-kitāba","bil-ḥaqi","muṣaddiqan","limā","bayna","yadayhi","mina","al-kitābi","wamuhayminan","ʿalayhi","fa-uḥ'kum","baynahum","bimā","anzala","al-lahu","walā","tattabiʿ","ahwāahum","ʿammā","jāaka","mina","al-ḥaqi","likullin","jaʿalnā","minkum","shir'ʿatan","wamin'hājan","walaw","shāa","al-lahu","lajaʿalakum","ummatan","wāḥidatan","walākin","liyabluwakum","fī","mā","ātākum","fa-is'tabiqū","al-khayrāti","ilā","al-lahi","marjiʿukum","jamīʿan","fayunabbi-ukum","bimā","kuntum","fīhi","takhtalifūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,3680],[2,3680,4510],[3,4510,5590],[4,5590,6520],[5,6520,7680],[6,7680,8370],[7,8370,9000],[8,9000,9900],[9,9900,10230],[10,10230,11310],[11,11310,12730],[12,12730,13720],[13,13720,15370],[14,15370,16730],[15,16730,18220],[16,18220,20110],[17,20110,21580],[18,21580,24020],[19,24020,24560],[20,24560,25620],[21,25620,28090],[22,28090,29280],[23,29280,31680],[24,31680,32060],[25,32060,33190],[26,33190,34250],[27,34250,35890],[28,35890,37130],[29,37130,38860],[30,38860,40880],[31,40880,41400],[32,41400,43170],[33,43170,44110],[34,44110,45300],[35,45300,47240],[36,47240,48869],[37,48869,49829],[38,49829,51209],[39,51209,51439],[40,51439,53009],[41,53009,55289],[42,55289,56259],[43,56259,59419],[44,59419,59759],[45,59759,60659],[46,60659,61939],[47,61939,63389],[48,63389,65519],[49,65519,66009],[50,66009,67489],[51,67489,68149],[52,68149,70884]]}}
