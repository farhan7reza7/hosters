{"name":"2:264","price":" 264. O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allâh, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allâh does not guide the disbelieving people.","arabic":"يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَا تُبۡطِلُواْ صَدَقَٰتِكُم بِٱلۡمَنِّ وَٱلۡأَذَىٰ كَٱلَّذِي يُنفِقُ مَالَهُۥ رِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَا يُؤۡمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَٱلۡيَوۡمِ ٱلۡأٓخِرِۖ فَمَثَلُهُۥ كَمَثَلِ صَفۡوَانٍ عَلَيۡهِ تُرَابٞ فَأَصَابَهُۥ وَابِلٞ فَتَرَكَهُۥ صَلۡدٗاۖ لَّا يَقۡدِرُونَ عَلَىٰ شَيۡءٖ مِّمَّا كَسَبُواْۗ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهۡدِي ٱلۡقَوۡمَ ٱلۡكَٰفِرِينَ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":271,"juzNumber":3,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"yāayyuhā alladhīna āmanū lā tub'ṭilū ṣadaqātikum bil-mani wal-adhā ka-alladhī yunfiqu mālahu riāa al-nāsi walā yu'minu bil-lahi wal-yawmi al-ākhiri famathaluhu kamathali ṣafwānin ʿalayhi turābun fa-aṣābahu wābilun fatarakahu ṣaldan lā yaqdirūna ʿalā shayin mimmā kasabū wal-lahu lā yahdī al-qawma al-kāfirīna ","translations":["O you","who","believe[d]","(Do) not","render in vain","your charities","with reminders (of it)","or [the] hurt","like the one who","spends","his wealth","(to) be seen","(by) the people","and (does) not","believe","in Allah","and the Day","[the] Last","Then his example","(is) like","(that of a) smooth rock","upon it","(is) dust","then fell on it","heavy rain","then left it","bare","Not","they have control","on","anything","of what","they (have) earned","And Allah","(does) not","guide","the people","[the] disbelieving","(264)"],"transliterationArr":["yāayyuhā","alladhīna","āmanū","lā","tub'ṭilū","ṣadaqātikum","bil-mani","wal-adhā","ka-alladhī","yunfiqu","mālahu","riāa","al-nāsi","walā","yu'minu","bil-lahi","wal-yawmi","al-ākhiri","famathaluhu","kamathali","ṣafwānin","ʿalayhi","turābun","fa-aṣābahu","wābilun","fatarakahu","ṣaldan","lā","yaqdirūna","ʿalā","shayin","mimmā","kasabū","wal-lahu","lā","yahdī","al-qawma","al-kāfirīna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,2620],[2,2620,3510],[3,3510,4400],[4,4400,4720],[5,4720,5600],[6,5600,7630],[7,7630,8870],[8,8870,9720],[9,9720,10760],[10,10760,12020],[11,12020,12900],[12,12900,15050],[13,15050,16540],[14,16540,17110],[15,17110,17810],[16,17810,18810],[17,18810,19720],[18,19720,20610],[19,20610,22060],[20,22060,22770],[21,22770,23900],[22,23900,24710],[23,24710,26180],[24,26180,27630],[25,27630,29010],[26,29010,30150],[27,30150,31100],[28,31100,32010],[29,32010,33050],[30,33050,33630],[31,33630,34300],[32,34300,35960],[33,35960,36870],[34,36870,38220],[35,38220,38610],[36,38610,39230],[37,39230,39940],[38,39940,42325]]}}
