{"name":"9:111","price":" 111. Verily, Allâh has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allâh’s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Qur’ân. And who is truer to his covenant than Allâh? Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.[1]","arabic":"۞ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ ٱشۡتَرَىٰ مِنَ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ أَنفُسَهُمۡ وَأَمۡوَٰلَهُم بِأَنَّ لَهُمُ ٱلۡجَنَّةَۚ يُقَٰتِلُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَيَقۡتُلُونَ وَيُقۡتَلُونَۖ وَعۡدًا عَلَيۡهِ حَقّٗا فِي ٱلتَّوۡرَىٰةِ وَٱلۡإِنجِيلِ وَٱلۡقُرۡءَانِۚ وَمَنۡ أَوۡفَىٰ بِعَهۡدِهِۦ مِنَ ٱللَّهِۚ فَٱسۡتَبۡشِرُواْ بِبَيۡعِكُمُ ٱلَّذِي بَايَعۡتُم بِهِۦۚ وَذَٰلِكَ هُوَ ٱلۡفَوۡزُ ٱلۡعَظِيمُ","category":["9 (At-Tawbah)","At-Tawbah","Surah At-Tawbah","Chapter At-Tawbah","Tawbah","Surah Tawbah","Chapter Tawbah","At Tawbah","Surah At Tawbah","Chapter At Tawbah","Surah 9","Chapter 9","The Repentance","التوبَة"],"ayahNumber":1346,"juzNumber":11,"footnotes":"(V.9:111)\na) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"Allâh guarantees him who strives in His Cause and whose motivation for going out is nothing but Jihâd in His Cause and belief in His Words (Islamic Monotheism), that He will admit him into Paradise (if martyred) or bring him back to his dwelling place whence he has come out with what he gains of reward or booty.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.352).\nb) Narrated Jâbir bin ‘Abdullâh رضي الله عنهما : On the day of the battle of Uhud, a man came to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and said, \"Can you tell me where I will be if I should get martyred?\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied, \"In Paradise.\" The man threw away some dates he was carrying in his hand, and fought till he was martyred.
