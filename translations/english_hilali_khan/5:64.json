{"name":"5:64","price":" 64. The Jews say: \"Allâh’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).\" Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands[3] are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills. Verily, the Revelation that has come to you from your Lord (Allâh) increases in most of them (their) obstinate rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allâh extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allâh does not like the Mufsidûn (mischief-makers).","arabic":"وَقَالَتِ ٱلۡيَهُودُ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ مَغۡلُولَةٌۚ غُلَّتۡ أَيۡدِيهِمۡ وَلُعِنُواْ بِمَا قَالُواْۘ بَلۡ يَدَاهُ مَبۡسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيۡفَ يَشَآءُۚ وَلَيَزِيدَنَّ كَثِيرٗا مِّنۡهُم مَّآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيۡكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ طُغۡيَٰنٗا وَكُفۡرٗاۚ وَأَلۡقَيۡنَا بَيۡنَهُمُ ٱلۡعَدَٰوَةَ وَٱلۡبَغۡضَآءَ إِلَىٰ يَوۡمِ ٱلۡقِيَٰمَةِۚ كُلَّمَآ أَوۡقَدُواْ نَارٗا لِّلۡحَرۡبِ أَطۡفَأَهَا ٱللَّهُۚ وَيَسۡعَوۡنَ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ فَسَادٗاۚ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ ٱلۡمُفۡسِدِينَ","category":["5 (Al-Ma'idah)","Al-Ma'idah","Surah Al-Ma'idah","Chapter Al-Ma'idah","Ma'idah","Surah Ma'idah","Chapter Ma'idah","Al Ma'idah","Surah Al Ma'idah","Chapter Al Ma'idah","Surah 5","Chapter 5","The Table Spread","المَائدة"],"ayahNumber":733,"juzNumber":6,"footnotes":" (V.5:64) Sifât-ullâh صفات الله عز وجل (Qualities of Allâh): [See the footnote of (V.3:73)].\nNarrated Ibn ‘Umar: رضي الله عنهما Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, Allâh will grasp the whole (planet of) earth by His Hand, and all the heavens in His Right, and then He will say, ‘I am the King’ \".\nAbu Hurairah said, \"Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said, ‘Allâh will grasp the (planet of) earth’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhârî, Vol.9, Hadîth No. 509).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"waqālati al-yahūdu yadu al-lahi maghlūlatun ghullat aydīhim waluʿinū bimā qālū bal yadāhu mabsūṭatāni yunfiqu kayfa yashāu walayazīdanna kathīran min'hum mā unzila ilayka min rabbika ṭugh'yānan wakuf'ran wa-alqaynā baynahumu al-ʿadāwata wal-baghḍāa ilā yawmi al-qiyāmati kullamā awqadū nāran lil'ḥarbi aṭfa-ahā al-lahu wayasʿawna fī al-arḍi fasādan wal-lahu lā yuḥibbu al-muf'sidīna ","translations":["And said","the Jews","The Hand","(of) Allah","(is) chained","Are chained","their hands","and they have been cursed","for what","they said","Nay","His Hands","(are) stretched out","He spends","how","He wills","And surely increase","many","of them","what","has been revealed","to you","from","your Lord","(in) rebellion","and disbelief","And We have cast","among them","[the] enmity","and [the] hatred","till","(the) Day","(of) the Resurrection","Every time","they kindled","(the) fire","of [the] war","it (was) extinguished","(by) Allah","And they strive","in","the earth","spreading corruption","And Allah","(does) not","love","the corrupters","(64)"],"transliterationArr":["waqālati","al-yahūdu","yadu","al-lahi","maghlūlatun","ghullat","aydīhim","waluʿinū","bimā","qālū","bal","yadāhu","mabsūṭatāni","yunfiqu","kayfa","yashāu","walayazīdanna","kathīran","min'hum","mā","unzila","ilayka","min","rabbika","ṭugh'yānan","wakuf'ran","wa-alqaynā","baynahumu","al-ʿadāwata","wal-baghḍāa","ilā","yawmi","al-qiyāmati","kullamā","awqadū","nāran","lil'ḥarbi","aṭfa-ahā","al-lahu","wayasʿawna","fī","al-arḍi","fasādan","wal-lahu","lā","yuḥibbu","al-muf'sidīna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1290],[2,1290,2260],[3,2260,2630],[4,2630,3500],[5,3500,5130],[6,5130,6060],[7,6060,7300],[8,7300,8290],[9,8290,8940],[10,8940,9820],[11,9820,10570],[12,10570,11490],[13,11490,13190],[14,13190,14530],[15,14530,15130],[16,15130,17100],[17,17100,19550],[18,19550,20480],[19,20480,21820],[20,21820,24190],[21,24190,25650],[22,25650,26530],[23,26530,26770],[24,26770,27740],[25,27740,28890],[26,28890,31080],[27,31080,32490],[28,32490,33440],[29,33440,34850],[30,34850,36160],[31,36160,37920],[32,37920,38510],[33,38510,39140],[34,39140,40860],[35,40860,43030],[36,43030,44060],[37,44060,44850],[38,44850,45940],[39,45940,46930],[40,46930,49990],[41,49990,51120],[42,51120,51420],[43,51420,52190],[44,52190,53390],[45,53390,54700],[46,54700,55100],[47,55100,55880],[48,55880,58895]]}}
