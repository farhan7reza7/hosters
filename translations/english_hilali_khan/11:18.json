Did you hear anything from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم about An-Najwâ?\"* Ibn ‘Umar said, \"I heard the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saying, ‘The believer will be brought near his Lord.’\" (Hishâm, a subnarrator said, reporting the Prophet’s words), \"The believer will come near (his Lord) till his Lord covers him with His Screen and makes him confess his sins. (Allâh will ask him). ‘Do you know (that you did) such-and-such a sin.’ He will say twice, ‘Yes, I know I did commit those sins.’ Then Allâh will say, ‘I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today.’ Then the record of his good deeds will be folded up [i.e. the record (Book) of his good deeds will be given to him].
