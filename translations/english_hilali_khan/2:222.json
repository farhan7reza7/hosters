{"name":"2:222","price":" 222. They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allâh has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina). Truly, Allâh loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves (by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts, bodies, for their prayers).","arabic":"وَيَسۡـَٔلُونَكَ عَنِ ٱلۡمَحِيضِۖ قُلۡ هُوَ أَذٗى فَٱعۡتَزِلُواْ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فِي ٱلۡمَحِيضِ وَلَا تَقۡرَبُوهُنَّ حَتَّىٰ يَطۡهُرۡنَۖ فَإِذَا تَطَهَّرۡنَ فَأۡتُوهُنَّ مِنۡ حَيۡثُ أَمَرَكُمُ ٱللَّهُۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحِبُّ ٱلتَّوَّٰبِينَ وَيُحِبُّ ٱلۡمُتَطَهِّرِينَ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":229,"juzNumber":2,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wayasalūnaka ʿani al-maḥīḍi qul huwa adhan fa-iʿ'tazilū al-nisāa fī al-maḥīḍi walā taqrabūhunna ḥattā yaṭhur'na fa-idhā taṭahharna fatūhunna min ḥaythu amarakumu al-lahu inna al-laha yuḥibbu al-tawābīna wayuḥibbu al-mutaṭahirīna ","translations":["And they ask you","about","[the] menstruation","Say","It","(is) a hurt","so keep away (from)","[the] women","during","(their) [the] menstruation","And (do) not","approach them","until","they are cleansed","Then when","they are purified","then come to them","from","where","has ordered you","Allah","Indeed","Allah","loves","those who turn in repentance","and loves","those who purify themselves","(222)"],"transliterationArr":["wayasalūnaka","ʿani","al-maḥīḍi","qul","huwa","adhan","fa-iʿ'tazilū","al-nisāa","fī","al-maḥīḍi","walā","taqrabūhunna","ḥattā","yaṭhur'na","fa-idhā","taṭahharna","fatūhunna","min","ḥaythu","amarakumu","al-lahu","inna","al-laha","yuḥibbu","al-tawābīna","wayuḥibbu","al-mutaṭahirīna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1510],[2,1510,1890],[3,1890,3970],[4,3970,4840],[5,4840,5160],[6,5160,6510],[7,6510,7370],[8,7370,9850],[9,9850,10060],[10,10060,12040],[11,12040,13130],[12,13130,15110],[13,15110,15880],[14,15880,17300],[15,17300,18010],[16,18010,19130],[17,19130,21030],[18,21030,21370],[19,21370,21960],[20,21960,22900],[21,22900,25150],[22,25150,26380],[23,26380,27180],[24,27180,27930],[25,27930,29450],[26,29450,30220],[27,30220,33445]]}}
