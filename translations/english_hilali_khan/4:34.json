{"name":"4:34","price":"34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allâh and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allâh orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband’s property). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allâh is Ever Most High, Most Great.","arabic":"ٱلرِّجَالُ قَوَّٰمُونَ عَلَى ٱلنِّسَآءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بَعۡضَهُمۡ عَلَىٰ بَعۡضٖ وَبِمَآ أَنفَقُواْ مِنۡ أَمۡوَٰلِهِمۡۚ فَٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتُ قَٰنِتَٰتٌ حَٰفِظَٰتٞ لِّلۡغَيۡبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ ٱللَّهُۚ وَٱلَّٰتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَٱهۡجُرُوهُنَّ فِي ٱلۡمَضَاجِعِ وَٱضۡرِبُوهُنَّۖ فَإِنۡ أَطَعۡنَكُمۡ فَلَا تَبۡغُواْ عَلَيۡهِنَّ سَبِيلًاۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيّٗا كَبِيرٗا","category":["4 (An-Nisa)","An-Nisa","Surah An-Nisa","Chapter An-Nisa","Nisa","Surah Nisa","Chapter Nisa","An Nisa","Surah An Nisa","Chapter An Nisa","Surah 4","Chapter 4","The Women","النِّسَاء"],"ayahNumber":527,"juzNumber":5,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"al-rijālu qawwāmūna ʿalā al-nisāi bimā faḍḍala al-lahu baʿḍahum ʿalā baʿḍin wabimā anfaqū min amwālihim fal-ṣāliḥātu qānitātun ḥāfiẓātun lil'ghaybi bimā ḥafiẓa al-lahu wa-allātī takhāfūna nushūzahunna faʿiẓūhunna wa-uh'jurūhunna fī al-maḍājiʿi wa-iḍ'ribūhunna fa-in aṭaʿnakum falā tabghū ʿalayhinna sabīlan inna al-laha kāna ʿaliyyan kabīran ","translations":["[The] men","(are) protectors","of","the women","because","(has) bestowed","Allah","some of them","over","others","and because","they spend","from","their wealth","So the righteous women","(are) obedient","guarding","in the unseen","that which","(orders) them to guard","(by) Allah","And those (from) whom","you fear","their ill-conduct","then advise them","and forsake them","in","the bed","and [finally] strike them","Then if","they obey you","then (do) not","seek","against them","a way","Indeed","Allah","is","Most High","Most Great","(34)"],"transliterationArr":["al-rijālu","qawwāmūna","ʿalā","al-nisāi","bimā","faḍḍala","al-lahu","baʿḍahum","ʿalā","baʿḍin","wabimā","anfaqū","min","amwālihim","fal-ṣāliḥātu","qānitātun","ḥāfiẓātun","lil'ghaybi","bimā","ḥafiẓa","al-lahu","wa-allātī","takhāfūna","nushūzahunna","faʿiẓūhunna","wa-uh'jurūhunna","fī","al-maḍājiʿi","wa-iḍ'ribūhunna","fa-in","aṭaʿnakum","falā","tabghū","ʿalayhinna","sabīlan","inna","al-laha","kāna","ʿaliyyan","kabīran",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1450],[2,1450,2890],[3,2890,3300],[4,3300,6219],[5,6219,6769],[6,6769,7549],[7,7549,8509],[8,8509,9529],[9,9529,10239],[10,10239,11629],[11,11629,13699],[12,13699,15099],[13,15099,15499],[14,15499,16889],[15,16889,18949],[16,18949,20309],[17,20309,21669],[18,21669,22929],[19,22929,23469],[20,23469,24039],[21,24039,26649],[22,26649,27879],[23,27879,29149],[24,29149,30879],[25,30879,32979],[26,32979,34979],[27,34979,35199],[28,35199,36519],[29,36519,38759],[30,38759,39819],[31,39819,41109],[32,41109,41719],[33,41719,42649],[34,42649,44659],[35,44659,46229],[36,46229,47509],[37,47509,48419],[38,48419,49029],[39,49029,50639],[40,50639,52324]]}}
