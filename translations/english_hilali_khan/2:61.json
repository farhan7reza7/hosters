{"name":"2:61","price":" 61. And (remember) when you said, \"O Mûsâ (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Fûm (wheat or garlic), its lentils and its onions.\" He said, \"Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower? Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!\" And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the Wrath of Allâh. That was because they used to disbelieve the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) of Allâh and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allâh, i.e. commit crimes and sins).","arabic":"وَإِذۡ قُلۡتُمۡ يَٰمُوسَىٰ لَن نَّصۡبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٖ وَٰحِدٖ فَٱدۡعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخۡرِجۡ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنۢبِتُ ٱلۡأَرۡضُ مِنۢ بَقۡلِهَا وَقِثَّآئِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَاۖ قَالَ أَتَسۡتَبۡدِلُونَ ٱلَّذِي هُوَ أَدۡنَىٰ بِٱلَّذِي هُوَ خَيۡرٌۚ ٱهۡبِطُواْ مِصۡرٗا فَإِنَّ لَكُم مَّا سَأَلۡتُمۡۗ وَضُرِبَتۡ عَلَيۡهِمُ ٱلذِّلَّةُ وَٱلۡمَسۡكَنَةُ وَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٖ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمۡ كَانُواْ يَكۡفُرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَقۡتُلُونَ ٱلنَّبِيِّـۧنَ بِغَيۡرِ ٱلۡحَقِّۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَواْ وَّكَانُواْ يَعۡتَدُونَ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":68,"juzNumber":1,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wa-idh qul'tum yāmūsā lan naṣbira ʿalā ṭaʿāmin wāḥidin fa-ud'ʿu lanā rabbaka yukh'rij lanā mimmā tunbitu al-arḍu min baqlihā waqithāihā wafūmihā waʿadasihā wabaṣalihā qāla atastabdilūna alladhī huwa adnā bi-alladhī huwa khayrun ih'biṭū miṣ'ran fa-inna lakum mā sa-altum waḍuribat ʿalayhimu al-dhilatu wal-maskanatu wabāū bighaḍabin mina al-lahi dhālika bi-annahum kānū yakfurūna biāyāti al-lahi wayaqtulūna al-nabiyīna bighayri al-ḥaqi dhālika bimā ʿaṣaw wakānū yaʿtadūna ","translations":["And when","you said","O Musa","Never (will)","we endure","[on]","food","(of) one (kind)","so pray","for us","(to) your Lord","to bring forth","for us","out of what","grows","the earth","of","its herbs","[and] its cucumbers","[and] its garlic","[and] its lentils","and its onions","He said","Would you exchange","that which","[it]","(is) inferior","for that which","[it]","(is) better","Go down","(to) a city","so indeed","for you","(is) what","you have asked (for)","And were struck","on them","the humiliation","and the misery","and they drew on themselves","wrath","of","Allah","That (was)","because they","used to","disbelieve","in (the) Signs","(of) Allah","and kill","the Prophets","without (any)","[the] right","That","(was) because","they disobeyed","and they were","transgressing","(61)"],"transliterationArr":["wa-idh","qul'tum","yāmūsā","lan","naṣbira","ʿalā","ṭaʿāmin","wāḥidin","fa-ud'ʿu","lanā","rabbaka","yukh'rij","lanā","mimmā","tunbitu","al-arḍu","min","baqlihā","waqithāihā","wafūmihā","waʿadasihā","wabaṣalihā","qāla","atastabdilūna","alladhī","huwa","adnā","bi-alladhī","huwa","khayrun","ih'biṭū","miṣ'ran","fa-inna","lakum","mā","sa-altum","waḍuribat","ʿalayhimu","al-dhilatu","wal-maskanatu","wabāū","bighaḍabin","mina","al-lahi","dhālika","bi-annahum","kānū","yakfurūna","biāyāti","al-lahi","wayaqtulūna","al-nabiyīna","bighayri","al-ḥaqi","dhālika","bimā","ʿaṣaw","wakānū","yaʿtadūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,580],[2,580,1430],[3,1430,2600],[4,2600,2860],[5,2860,4220],[6,4220,4680],[7,4680,6250],[8,6250,7810],[9,7810,8340],[10,8340,8890],[11,8890,10060],[12,10060,10690],[13,10690,11210],[14,11210,12040],[15,12040,12840],[16,12840,13380],[17,13380,14640],[18,14640,16050],[19,16050,16850],[20,16850,17720],[21,17720,18730],[22,18730,21250],[23,21250,23120],[24,23120,24170],[25,24170,25470],[26,25470,26520],[27,26520,28130],[28,28130,28950],[29,28950,29270],[30,29270,30080],[31,30080,31030],[32,31030,31450],[33,31450,33870],[34,33870,34820],[35,34820,36450],[36,36450,37720],[37,37720,38330],[38,38330,39450],[39,39450,40870],[40,40870,41780],[41,41780,42710],[42,42710,43810],[43,43810,45120],[44,45120,47390],[45,47390,48200],[46,48200,49190],[47,49190,52250],[48,52250,53030],[49,53030,54670],[50,54670,55400],[51,55400,56530],[52,56530,57740],[53,57740,58430],[54,58430,59730],[55,59730,61450],[56,61450,62220],[57,62220,63340],[58,63340,64110],[59,64110,64650],[60,64650,65280],[61,65280,66270],[62,66270,68865]]}}
