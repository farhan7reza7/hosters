You are under Allâh’s Order and I am under Allâh’s Order. O Allâh! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.’ It was stopped till Allâh made him victorious. Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it did not burn it*. He said (to his men), ‘Some of you have stolen something from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a Bai‘a (pledge) by shaking hands with me.’ (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck in the hand of their Prophet. Then that Prophet said (to the man), ‘The theft has been committed by your people. So all the persons of your tribe should give me the Bai‘a (pledge) by shaking hands with me.’ The hands of two or three men got stuck in the hand of their Prophet and he said, ‘You have committed the theft.’ Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم added: \"Then Allâh saw our weakness and disability, so He made booty legal for us.\" (Sahin Al-Bukhâri, Vol.4, Hadîth No.353).\n* Booty used to be burnt by a fire sent by Allâh.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"innamā al-sabīlu ʿalā alladhīna yastadhinūnaka wahum aghniyāu raḍū bi-an yakūnū maʿa al-khawālifi waṭabaʿa al-lahu ʿalā qulūbihim fahum lā yaʿlamūna ","translations":["Only","the way (blame)","(is) on","those who","ask your permission","while they","(are) rich","They (are) satisfied","to","be","with","those who stay behind","and Allah sealed","and Allah sealed","[on]","their hearts","so they","(do) not","know","(93)"],"transliterationArr":["innamā","al-sabīlu","ʿalā","alladhīna","yastadhinūnaka","wahum","aghniyāu","raḍū","bi-an","yakūnū","maʿa","al-khawālifi","waṭabaʿa","al-lahu","ʿalā","qulūbihim","fahum","lā","yaʿlamūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1680],[2,1680,2860],[3,2860,3290],[4,3290,4310],[5,4310,6500],[6,6500,7100],[7,7100,10200],[8,10200,11400],[9,11400,11920],[10,11920,13890],[11,13890,14300],[12,14300,15770],[13,15770,16690],[14,16690,17600],[15,17600,18270],[16,18270,19670],[17,19670,20260],[18,20260,20840],[19,20840,24225]]}}
