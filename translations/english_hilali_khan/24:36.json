And this is because if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque, with the sole intention of praying: then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is taken off (crossed out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers his Salât (prayer), the angels keep on asking Allâh’s Blessings and Allâh’s Forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his Musallâ (place of prayer). They say: ‘O Allâh! Bestow Your Blessings upon him, be merciful and kind to him.’ And one is regarded in Salât (prayer) as long as one is waiting for the Salât (prayer).\" (Sahih Al Bukhâri, Vol.1, Hadith No.620).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"fī buyūtin adhina al-lahu an tur'faʿa wayudh'kara fīhā us'muhu yusabbiḥu lahu fīhā bil-ghuduwi wal-āṣāli ","translations":["In","houses","(which) Allah ordered","(which) Allah ordered","that","they be raised","and be mentioned","in them","His name","Glorify","[to] Him","in them","in the mornings","and (in) the evenings","(36)"],"transliterationArr":["fī","buyūtin","adhina","al-lahu","an","tur'faʿa","wayudh'kara","fīhā","us'muhu","yusabbiḥu","lahu","fīhā","bil-ghuduwi","wal-āṣāli",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,490],[2,490,1670],[3,1670,2280],[4,2280,3300],[5,3300,4380],[6,4380,5460],[7,5460,6460],[8,6460,7060],[9,7060,7980],[10,7980,9190],[11,9190,9820],[12,9820,10860],[13,10860,12370],[14,12370,13030],[15,13030,13980],[16,13980,15400],[17,15400,18885]]}}
