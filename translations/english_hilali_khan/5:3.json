{"name":"5:3","price":"3. Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maitah (the dead animals - cattle - beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allâh’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering, (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allâh, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns - and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal - unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) - and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub [1] (stone-altars). (Forbidden) also is to use arrows seeking luck or decision; (all) that is Fisqun (disobedience of Allâh and sin). This day, those who disbelieved have given up all hope of your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion. But as for him who is forced by severe hunger, with no inclination to sin (such can eat these above mentioned meats), then surely, Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","arabic":"حُرِّمَتۡ عَلَيۡكُمُ ٱلۡمَيۡتَةُ وَٱلدَّمُ وَلَحۡمُ ٱلۡخِنزِيرِ وَمَآ أُهِلَّ لِغَيۡرِ ٱللَّهِ بِهِۦ وَٱلۡمُنۡخَنِقَةُ وَٱلۡمَوۡقُوذَةُ وَٱلۡمُتَرَدِّيَةُ وَٱلنَّطِيحَةُ وَمَآ أَكَلَ ٱلسَّبُعُ إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيۡتُمۡ وَمَا ذُبِحَ عَلَى ٱلنُّصُبِ وَأَن تَسۡتَقۡسِمُواْ بِٱلۡأَزۡلَٰمِۚ ذَٰلِكُمۡ فِسۡقٌۗ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ يَئِسَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن دِينِكُمۡ فَلَا تَخۡشَوۡهُمۡ وَٱخۡشَوۡنِۚ ٱلۡيَوۡمَ أَكۡمَلۡتُ لَكُمۡ دِينَكُمۡ وَأَتۡمَمۡتُ عَلَيۡكُمۡ نِعۡمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ ٱلۡإِسۡلَٰمَ دِينٗاۚ فَمَنِ ٱضۡطُرَّ فِي مَخۡمَصَةٍ غَيۡرَ مُتَجَانِفٖ لِّإِثۡمٖ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٞ رَّحِيمٞ","category":["5 (Al-Ma'idah)","Al-Ma'idah","Surah Al-Ma'idah","Chapter Al-Ma'idah","Ma'idah","Surah Ma'idah","Chapter Ma'idah","Al Ma'idah","Surah Al Ma'idah","Chapter Al Ma'idah","Surah 5","Chapter 5","The Table Spread","المَائدة"],"ayahNumber":672,"juzNumber":6,"footnotes":"(V.5:3) See the footnotes of (V.2:135) and (V.5:90).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"ḥurrimat ʿalaykumu al-maytatu wal-damu walaḥmu al-khinzīri wamā uhilla lighayri al-lahi bihi wal-mun'khaniqatu wal-mawqūdhatu wal-mutaradiyatu wal-naṭīḥatu wamā akala al-sabuʿu illā mā dhakkaytum wamā dhubiḥa ʿalā al-nuṣubi wa-an tastaqsimū bil-azlāmi dhālikum fis'qun al-yawma ya-isa alladhīna kafarū min dīnikum falā takhshawhum wa-ikh'shawni al-yawma akmaltu lakum dīnakum wa-atmamtu ʿalaykum niʿ'matī waraḍītu lakumu al-is'lāma dīnan famani uḍ'ṭurra fī makhmaṣatin ghayra mutajānifin li-ith'min fa-inna al-laha ghafūrun raḥīmun ","translations":["Are made unlawful","on you","the dead animals","and the blood","and flesh","(of) the swine","and what","has been dedicated","to other than","Allah","[on it]","and that which is strangled (to death)","and that which is hit fatally","and that which has a fatal fall","and that which is gored by horns","and that which","ate (it)","the wild animal","except","what","you slaughtered","and what","is sacrificed","on","the stone altars","and that","you seek division","by divining arrows ","that","(is) grave disobedience","This day","(have) despaired","those who","disbelieved","of","your religion","so (do) not","fear them","but fear Me","This day","I have perfected","for you","your religion","and I have completed","upon you","My Favor","and I have approved","for you","[the] Islam","(as) a religion","But whoever","(is) forced","by","hunger","(and) not","inclining","to sin","then indeed","Allah","(is) Oft-Forgiving","Most Merciful","(3)"],"transliterationArr":["ḥurrimat","ʿalaykumu","al-maytatu","wal-damu","walaḥmu","al-khinzīri","wamā","uhilla","lighayri","al-lahi","bihi","wal-mun'khaniqatu","wal-mawqūdhatu","wal-mutaradiyatu","wal-naṭīḥatu","wamā","akala","al-sabuʿu","illā","mā","dhakkaytum","wamā","dhubiḥa","ʿalā","al-nuṣubi","wa-an","tastaqsimū","bil-azlāmi","dhālikum","fis'qun","al-yawma","ya-isa","alladhīna","kafarū","min","dīnikum","falā","takhshawhum","wa-ikh'shawni","al-yawma","akmaltu","lakum","dīnakum","wa-atmamtu","ʿalaykum","niʿ'matī","waraḍītu","lakumu","al-is'lāma","dīnan","famani","uḍ'ṭurra","fī","makhmaṣatin","ghayra","mutajānifin","li-ith'min","fa-inna","al-laha","ghafūrun","raḥīmun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1250],[2,1250,2380],[3,2380,3610],[4,3610,4460],[5,4460,5160],[6,5160,7490],[7,7490,9630],[8,9630,10420],[9,10420,11390],[10,11390,12280],[11,12280,12880],[12,12880,15340],[13,15340,17270],[14,17270,18990],[15,18990,20910],[16,20910,22850],[17,22850,24360],[18,24360,24880],[19,24880,25880],[20,25880,26710],[21,26710,27130],[22,27130,28450],[23,28450,29070],[24,29070,29680],[25,29680,30110],[26,30110,31500],[27,31500,32610],[28,32610,34160],[29,34160,37120],[30,37120,38650],[31,38650,39350],[32,39350,40700],[33,40700,41400],[34,41400,42500],[35,42500,43380],[36,43380,44390],[37,44390,45440],[38,45440,46060],[39,46060,47460],[40,47460,48280],[41,48280,51170],[42,51170,52280],[43,52280,52930],[44,52930,53990],[45,53990,55280],[46,55280,56420],[47,56420,57400],[48,57400,58490],[49,58490,59130],[50,59130,60420],[51,60420,61890],[52,61890,62510],[53,62510,63440],[54,63440,63890],[55,63890,65110],[56,65110,65750],[57,65750,67150],[58,67150,68180],[59,68180,70190],[60,70190,71160],[61,71160,71980],[62,71980,74465]]}}
