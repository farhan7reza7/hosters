{"name":"2:253","price":"253. Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others; to some of them Allâh spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honour); and to ‘Îsâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), We gave clear proofs and evidence, and supported him with Rûh-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel)]. If Allâh had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allâh had come to them, but they differed - some of them believed and others disbelieved. If Allâh had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but Allâh does what He likes.","arabic":"۞ تِلۡكَ ٱلرُّسُلُ فَضَّلۡنَا بَعۡضَهُمۡ عَلَىٰ بَعۡضٖۘ مِّنۡهُم مَّن كَلَّمَ ٱللَّهُۖ وَرَفَعَ بَعۡضَهُمۡ دَرَجَٰتٖۚ وَءَاتَيۡنَا عِيسَى ٱبۡنَ مَرۡيَمَ ٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتِ وَأَيَّدۡنَٰهُ بِرُوحِ ٱلۡقُدُسِۗ وَلَوۡ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقۡتَتَلَ ٱلَّذِينَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِهِم مِّنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا جَآءَتۡهُمُ ٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتُ وَلَٰكِنِ ٱخۡتَلَفُواْ فَمِنۡهُم مَّنۡ ءَامَنَ وَمِنۡهُم مَّن كَفَرَۚ وَلَوۡ شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مَا ٱقۡتَتَلُواْ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَفۡعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":260,"juzNumber":3,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"til'ka al-rusulu faḍḍalnā baʿḍahum ʿalā baʿḍin min'hum man kallama al-lahu warafaʿa baʿḍahum darajātin waātaynā ʿīsā ib'na maryama al-bayināti wa-ayyadnāhu birūḥi al-qudusi walaw shāa al-lahu mā iq'tatala alladhīna min baʿdihim min baʿdi mā jāathumu al-bayinātu walākini ikh'talafū famin'hum man āmana wamin'hum man kafara walaw shāa al-lahu mā iq'tatalū walākinna al-laha yafʿalu mā yurīdu ","translations":["These","(are) the Messengers","We (have) preferred","some of them","over","others","Among them","(were those with) whom","spoke","Allah","and He raised","some of them","(in) degrees","And We gave","Isa","son","(of) Maryam","the clear proofs","and We supported him","with Spirit","[the] Holy","And if","(had) willed","Allah","not","(would have) fought each other","those who","(came) from","after them","from","after","[what]","came to them","the clear proofs","[And] but","they differed","[so] of them","(are some) who","believed","and of them","(are some) who","denied","And if","(had) willed","Allah","not","they (would have) fought each other","[and] but","Allah","does","what","He intends","(253)"],"transliterationArr":["til'ka","al-rusulu","faḍḍalnā","baʿḍahum","ʿalā","baʿḍin","min'hum","man","kallama","al-lahu","warafaʿa","baʿḍahum","darajātin","waātaynā","ʿīsā","ib'na","maryama","al-bayināti","wa-ayyadnāhu","birūḥi","al-qudusi","walaw","shāa","al-lahu","mā","iq'tatala","alladhīna","min","baʿdihim","min","baʿdi","mā","jāathumu","al-bayinātu","walākini","ikh'talafū","famin'hum","man","āmana","wamin'hum","man","kafara","walaw","shāa","al-lahu","mā","iq'tatalū","walākinna","al-laha","yafʿalu","mā","yurīdu",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1680],[2,1680,2400],[3,2400,3530],[4,3530,4430],[5,4430,5000],[6,5000,6000],[7,6000,6740],[8,6740,7570],[9,7570,8970],[10,8970,11050],[11,11050,11750],[12,11750,12650],[13,12650,14790],[14,14790,16480],[15,16480,17050],[16,17050,17460],[17,17460,18100],[18,18100,19480],[19,19480,20960],[20,20960,21680],[21,21680,22510],[22,22510,23220],[23,23220,25150],[24,25150,26010],[25,26010,26140],[26,26140,26850],[27,26850,27840],[28,27840,28620],[29,28620,29570],[30,29570,30970],[31,30970,31580],[32,31580,31930],[33,31930,34170],[34,34170,35560],[35,35560,36410],[36,36410,37320],[37,37320,38300],[38,38300,39180],[39,39180,39930],[40,39930,40800],[41,40800,41680],[42,41680,42370],[43,42370,43300],[44,43300,43820],[45,43820,45930],[46,45930,46750],[47,46750,46860],[48,46860,47910],[49,47910,49570],[50,49570,50380],[51,50380,51080],[52,51080,51480],[53,51480,53635]]}}
