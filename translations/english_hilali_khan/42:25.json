Anta khalaqtanî wa ana ‘abduka, wa ana ‘alâ ‘ahdika wa wa‘dika mastata‘tu.

None has the right to be worshipped but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wahuwa alladhī yaqbalu al-tawbata ʿan ʿibādihi wayaʿfū ʿani al-sayiāti wayaʿlamu mā tafʿalūna ","translations":["And He","(is) the One Who","accepts","the repentance","of","His slaves","and pardons","[of]","the evil","and He knows","what","you do","(25)"],"transliterationArr":["wahuwa","alladhī","yaqbalu","al-tawbata","ʿan","ʿibādihi","wayaʿfū","ʿani","al-sayiāti","wayaʿlamu","mā","tafʿalūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,670],[2,670,1600],[3,1600,2390],[4,2390,3430],[5,3430,3840],[6,3840,5110],[7,5110,6180],[8,6180,6580],[9,6580,8160],[10,8160,9230],[11,9230,9580],[12,9580,12585]]}}
