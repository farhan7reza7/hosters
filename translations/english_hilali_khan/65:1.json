{"name":"65:1","price":"1. O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods) and count (accurately) their ‘Iddah (periods[1]). And fear Allâh your Lord (O Muslims). And turn them not out of their (husband’s) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allâh. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allâh, then indeed he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not it may be that Allâh will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce).","arabic":"يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ إِذَا طَلَّقۡتُمُ ٱلنِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحۡصُواْ ٱلۡعِدَّةَۖ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّكُمۡۖ لَا تُخۡرِجُوهُنَّ مِنۢ بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلَا يَخۡرُجۡنَ إِلَّآ أَن يَأۡتِينَ بِفَٰحِشَةٖ مُّبَيِّنَةٖۚ وَتِلۡكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِۚ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ ٱللَّهِ فَقَدۡ ظَلَمَ نَفۡسَهُۥۚ لَا تَدۡرِي لَعَلَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحۡدِثُ بَعۡدَ ذَٰلِكَ أَمۡرٗا","category":["65 (At-Talaq)","At-Talaq","Surah At-Talaq","Chapter At-Talaq","Talaq","Surah Talaq","Chapter Talaq","At Talaq","Surah At Talaq","Chapter At Talaq","Surah 65","Chapter 65","The Divorce","الطلاق"],"ayahNumber":5218,"juzNumber":28,"footnotes":"(V.65:1) Narrated ‘Abdullâh bin ‘Umar رضي الله عنهما that he had divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم . ‘Umar bin Al-Khattâb رضي الله عنه asked Allâh’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم about that.
