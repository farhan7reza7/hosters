{"name":"47:4","price":" 4. So, when you meet (in fight - Jihâd in Allâh’s Cause) those who disbelieve, smite (their) necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom (according to what benefits Islâm), until the war lays down its burden. Thus [you are ordered by Allâh to continue in carrying out Jihâd against the disbelievers till they embrace Islâm and are saved from the punishment in the Hell-fire or at least come under your protection], but if it had been Allâh’s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those who are killed in the Way of Allâh, He will never let their deeds be lost.[2]","arabic":"فَإِذَا لَقِيتُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَضَرۡبَ ٱلرِّقَابِ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَثۡخَنتُمُوهُمۡ فَشُدُّواْ ٱلۡوَثَاقَ فَإِمَّا مَنَّۢا بَعۡدُ وَإِمَّا فِدَآءً حَتَّىٰ تَضَعَ ٱلۡحَرۡبُ أَوۡزَارَهَاۚ ذَٰلِكَۖ وَلَوۡ يَشَآءُ ٱللَّهُ لَٱنتَصَرَ مِنۡهُمۡ وَلَٰكِن لِّيَبۡلُوَاْ بَعۡضَكُم بِبَعۡضٖۗ وَٱلَّذِينَ قُتِلُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ فَلَن يُضِلَّ أَعۡمَٰلَهُمۡ","category":["47 (Muhammad)","Muhammad","Surah Muhammad","Chapter Muhammad","Surah 47","Chapter 47","Muhammad","مُحَمَّد"],"ayahNumber":4549,"juzNumber":26,"footnotes":"(V.47:4) See the footnote of (V.2:190) and (V.9:20).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"fa-idhā laqītumu alladhīna kafarū faḍarba al-riqābi ḥattā idhā athkhantumūhum fashuddū al-wathāqa fa-immā mannan baʿdu wa-immā fidāan ḥattā taḍaʿa al-ḥarbu awzārahā dhālika walaw yashāu al-lahu la-intaṣara min'hum walākin liyabluwā baʿḍakum bibaʿḍin wa-alladhīna qutilū fī sabīli al-lahi falan yuḍilla aʿmālahum ","translations":["So when","you meet","those who","disbelieve","then strike","the necks","until","when","you have subdued them","then bind firmly","the bond","then either","a favor","afterwards","or","ransom","until","lays down","the war","its burdens","That","And if","Allah had willed","Allah had willed","surely, He could have taken retribution","from them","but","to test","some of you","with others","And those who","are killed","in","(the) way of Allah","(the) way of Allah","then never","He will cause to be lost","their deeds","(4)"],"transliterationArr":["fa-idhā","laqītumu","alladhīna","kafarū","faḍarba","al-riqābi","ḥattā","idhā","athkhantumūhum","fashuddū","al-wathāqa","fa-immā","mannan","baʿdu","wa-immā","fidāan","ḥattā","taḍaʿa","al-ḥarbu","awzārahā","dhālika","walaw","yashāu","al-lahu","la-intaṣara","min'hum","walākin","liyabluwā","baʿḍakum","bibaʿḍin","wa-alladhīna","qutilū","fī","sabīli","al-lahi","falan","yuḍilla","aʿmālahum",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,870],[2,870,1890],[3,1890,2890],[4,2890,3760],[5,3760,4550],[6,4550,5690],[7,5690,7910],[8,7910,10490],[9,10490,12660],[10,12660,13510],[11,13510,14550],[12,14550,16500],[13,16500,17860],[14,17860,19040],[15,19040,19690],[16,19690,21400],[17,21400,24190],[18,24190,25000],[19,25000,25680],[20,25680,26550],[21,26550,28180],[22,28180,29970],[23,29970,30510],[24,30510,32720],[25,32720,33570],[26,33570,35350],[27,35350,36230],[28,36230,37120],[29,37120,38230],[30,38230,40270],[31,40270,41140],[32,41140,42730],[33,42730,43520],[34,43520,43950],[35,43950,45070],[36,45070,45680],[37,45680,46290],[38,46290,47950],[39,47950,49815]]}}
