{"name":"4:11","price":" 11. Allâh commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allâh. And Allâh is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.","arabic":"يُوصِيكُمُ ٱللَّهُ فِيٓ أَوۡلَٰدِكُمۡۖ لِلذَّكَرِ مِثۡلُ حَظِّ ٱلۡأُنثَيَيۡنِۚ فَإِن كُنَّ نِسَآءٗ فَوۡقَ ٱثۡنَتَيۡنِ فَلَهُنَّ ثُلُثَا مَا تَرَكَۖ وَإِن كَانَتۡ وَٰحِدَةٗ فَلَهَا ٱلنِّصۡفُۚ وَلِأَبَوَيۡهِ لِكُلِّ وَٰحِدٖ مِّنۡهُمَا ٱلسُّدُسُ مِمَّا تَرَكَ إِن كَانَ لَهُۥ وَلَدٞۚ فَإِن لَّمۡ يَكُن لَّهُۥ وَلَدٞ وَوَرِثَهُۥٓ أَبَوَاهُ فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلثُّلُثُۚ فَإِن كَانَ لَهُۥٓ إِخۡوَةٞ فَلِأُمِّهِ ٱلسُّدُسُۚ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ وَصِيَّةٖ يُوصِي بِهَآ أَوۡ دَيۡنٍۗ ءَابَآؤُكُمۡ وَأَبۡنَآؤُكُمۡ لَا تَدۡرُونَ أَيُّهُمۡ أَقۡرَبُ لَكُمۡ نَفۡعٗاۚ فَرِيضَةٗ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمٗا","category":["4 (An-Nisa)","An-Nisa","Surah An-Nisa","Chapter An-Nisa","Nisa","Surah Nisa","Chapter Nisa","An Nisa","Surah An Nisa","Chapter An Nisa","Surah 4","Chapter 4","The Women","النِّسَاء"],"ayahNumber":504,"juzNumber":4,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"yūṣīkumu al-lahu fī awlādikum lildhakari mith'lu ḥaẓẓi al-unthayayni fa-in kunna nisāan fawqa ith'natayni falahunna thuluthā mā taraka wa-in kānat wāḥidatan falahā al-niṣ'fu wali-abawayhi likulli wāḥidin min'humā al-sudusu mimmā taraka in kāna lahu waladun fa-in lam yakun lahu waladun wawarithahu abawāhu fali-ummihi al-thuluthu fa-in kāna lahu ikh'watun fali-ummihi al-sudusu min baʿdi waṣiyyatin yūṣī bihā aw daynin ābāukum wa-abnāukum lā tadrūna ayyuhum aqrabu lakum nafʿan farīḍatan mina al-lahi inna al-laha kāna ʿalīman ḥakīman ","translations":["Instructs you","Allah","concerning","your children ","for the male","like","(the) portion","(of) two females","But if","there are","(only) women","more (than)","two","then for them","two thirds","(of) what","he left","And if","(there) is","(only) one","then for her","(is) half","And for his parents","for each","one","of them","a sixth","of what","(is) left","if","is","for him","a child","But if","not","is","for him","any child","and inherit[ed] him","his parents","then for his mother","(is) one third","And if","are","for him","brothers and sisters","then for his mother","(is) the sixth","from","after","any will","he has made","[of which]","or","any debt","Your parents","and your children ","not","you know","which of them","(is) nearer","to you","(in) benefit","An obligation","from","Allah","Indeed","Allah","is","All-Knowing","All-Wise","(11)"],"transliterationArr":["yūṣīkumu","al-lahu","fī","awlādikum","lildhakari","mith'lu","ḥaẓẓi","al-unthayayni","fa-in","kunna","nisāan","fawqa","ith'natayni","falahunna","thuluthā","mā","taraka","wa-in","kānat","wāḥidatan","falahā","al-niṣ'fu","wali-abawayhi","likulli","wāḥidin","min'humā","al-sudusu","mimmā","taraka","in","kāna","lahu","waladun","fa-in","lam","yakun","lahu","waladun","wawarithahu","abawāhu","fali-ummihi","al-thuluthu","fa-in","kāna","lahu","ikh'watun","fali-ummihi","al-sudusu","min","baʿdi","waṣiyyatin","yūṣī","bihā","aw","daynin","ābāukum","wa-abnāukum","lā","tadrūna","ayyuhum","aqrabu","lakum","nafʿan","farīḍatan","mina","al-lahi","inna","al-laha","kāna","ʿalīman","ḥakīman",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1380],[2,1380,2280],[3,2280,3670],[4,3670,5090],[5,5090,6180],[6,6180,6790],[7,6790,7510],[8,7510,11140],[9,11140,12340],[10,12340,13370],[11,13370,16410],[12,16410,16930],[13,16930,18070],[14,18070,19430],[15,19430,20390],[16,20390,20770],[17,20770,21970],[18,21970,23380],[19,23380,24270],[20,24270,26190],[21,26190,26740],[22,26740,28220],[23,28220,30060],[24,30060,30900],[25,30900,31790],[26,31790,33270],[27,33270,34130],[28,34130,35440],[29,35440,36050],[30,36050,37160],[31,37160,37720],[32,37720,38460],[33,38460,39410],[34,39410,39820],[35,39820,40400],[36,40400,40860],[37,40860,41700],[38,41700,42840],[39,42840,45050],[40,45050,46080],[41,46080,47670],[42,47670,48470],[43,48470,50160],[44,50160,50780],[45,50780,52910],[46,52910,54440],[47,54440,56640],[48,56640,57520],[49,57520,58920],[50,58920,59590],[51,59590,61030],[52,61030,62200],[53,62200,63950],[54,63950,64360],[55,64360,66630],[56,66630,69400],[57,69400,72450],[58,72450,72850],[59,72850,73980],[60,73980,75130],[61,75130,75920],[62,75920,76670],[63,76670,78070],[64,78070,79220],[65,79220,80580],[66,80580,83350],[67,83350,84670],[68,84670,85500],[69,85500,86170],[70,86170,87250],[71,87250,88945]]}}
