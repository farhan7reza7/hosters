{"name":"2:233","price":" 233. The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child. And on the (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them. And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on reasonable basis. And fear Allâh and know that Allâh is All-Seer of what you do.","arabic":"۞ وَٱلۡوَٰلِدَٰتُ يُرۡضِعۡنَ أَوۡلَٰدَهُنَّ حَوۡلَيۡنِ كَامِلَيۡنِۖ لِمَنۡ أَرَادَ أَن يُتِمَّ ٱلرَّضَاعَةَۚ وَعَلَى ٱلۡمَوۡلُودِ لَهُۥ رِزۡقُهُنَّ وَكِسۡوَتُهُنَّ بِٱلۡمَعۡرُوفِۚ لَا تُكَلَّفُ نَفۡسٌ إِلَّا وُسۡعَهَاۚ لَا تُضَآرَّ وَٰلِدَةُۢ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلَا مَوۡلُودٞ لَّهُۥ بِوَلَدِهِۦۚ وَعَلَى ٱلۡوَارِثِ مِثۡلُ ذَٰلِكَۗ فَإِنۡ أَرَادَا فِصَالًا عَن تَرَاضٖ مِّنۡهُمَا وَتَشَاوُرٖ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيۡهِمَاۗ وَإِنۡ أَرَدتُّمۡ أَن تَسۡتَرۡضِعُوٓاْ أَوۡلَٰدَكُمۡ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ إِذَا سَلَّمۡتُم مَّآ ءَاتَيۡتُم بِٱلۡمَعۡرُوفِۗ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ وَٱعۡلَمُوٓاْ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا تَعۡمَلُونَ بَصِيرٞ","category":["2 (Al-Baqarah)","Al-Baqarah","Surah Al-Baqarah","Chapter Al-Baqarah","Baqarah","Surah Baqarah","Chapter Baqarah","Al Baqarah","Surah Al Baqarah","Chapter Al Baqarah","Surah 2","Chapter 2","The Cow","البَقَرَة"],"ayahNumber":240,"juzNumber":2,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"wal-wālidātu yur'ḍiʿ'na awlādahunna ḥawlayni kāmilayni liman arāda an yutimma al-raḍāʿata waʿalā al-mawlūdi lahu riz'quhunna wakis'watuhunna bil-maʿrūfi lā tukallafu nafsun illā wus'ʿahā lā tuḍārra wālidatun biwaladihā walā mawlūdun lahu biwaladihi waʿalā al-wārithi mith'lu dhālika fa-in arādā fiṣālan ʿan tarāḍin min'humā watashāwurin falā junāḥa ʿalayhimā wa-in aradttum an tastarḍiʿū awlādakum falā junāḥa ʿalaykum idhā sallamtum mā ātaytum bil-maʿrūfi wa-ittaqū al-laha wa-iʿ'lamū anna al-laha bimā taʿmalūna baṣīrun ","translations":["And the mothers","shall suckle","their children","(for) two years","complete","for whoever","wishes","to","complete","the suckling","And upon","the father","(on) him","(is) their provision","and their clothing","in a fair manner","Not","is burdened","any soul","except","its capacity","Not","made to suffer","(the) mother","because of her child","and not","(the) father","(be)","because of his child","And on","the (father's) heir","(is a duty) like","that (of the father)","Then if","they both desire","weaning","through","mutual consent","of both of them","and consultation","then no","blame","on both of them","And if","you want","to","ask another women to suckle","your child","then (there is) no","blame","on you","when","you pay","what","you give","in a fair manner","And fear","Allah","and know","that","Allah","of what","you do","(is) All-Seer","(233)"],"transliterationArr":["wal-wālidātu","yur'ḍiʿ'na","awlādahunna","ḥawlayni","kāmilayni","liman","arāda","an","yutimma","al-raḍāʿata","waʿalā","al-mawlūdi","lahu","riz'quhunna","wakis'watuhunna","bil-maʿrūfi","lā","tukallafu","nafsun","illā","wus'ʿahā","lā","tuḍārra","wālidatun","biwaladihā","walā","mawlūdun","lahu","biwaladihi","waʿalā","al-wārithi","mith'lu","dhālika","fa-in","arādā","fiṣālan","ʿan","tarāḍin","min'humā","watashāwurin","falā","junāḥa","ʿalayhimā","wa-in","aradttum","an","tastarḍiʿū","awlādakum","falā","junāḥa","ʿalaykum","idhā","sallamtum","mā","ātaytum","bil-maʿrūfi","wa-ittaqū","al-laha","wa-iʿ'lamū","anna","al-laha","bimā","taʿmalūna","baṣīrun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1380],[2,1380,2150],[3,2150,3860],[4,3860,4770],[5,4770,5800],[6,5800,6270],[7,6270,7020],[8,7020,7130],[9,7130,8960],[10,8960,10420],[11,10420,10890],[12,10890,11960],[13,11960,12360],[14,12360,13880],[15,13880,15730],[16,15730,17740],[17,17740,18340],[18,18340,19230],[19,19230,19800],[20,19800,20540],[21,20540,21550],[22,21550,22200],[23,22200,25440],[24,25440,26810],[25,26810,27850],[26,27850,28390],[27,28390,29240],[28,29240,29870],[29,29870,31090],[30,31090,31660],[31,31660,32570],[32,32570,33080],[33,33080,34130],[34,34130,34660],[35,34660,35500],[36,35500,36420],[37,36420,37190],[38,37190,38360],[39,38360,39610],[40,39610,40750],[41,40750,41810],[42,41810,42540],[43,42540,43620],[44,43620,44540],[45,44540,45380],[46,45380,46230],[47,46230,48440],[48,48440,49640],[49,49640,50160],[50,50160,50860],[51,50860,51770],[52,51770,52230],[53,52230,53240],[54,53240,55310],[55,55310,56940],[56,56940,59280],[57,59280,60240],[58,60240,61030],[59,61030,63040],[60,63040,64150],[61,64150,64940],[62,64940,65430],[63,65430,66580],[64,66580,68465]]}}
