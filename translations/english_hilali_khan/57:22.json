He will save you from every evil and will take care of you in all the spheres of life.\n(b) Be loyal and obedient to Allâh, you will find Him near (in front of you) i.e. He will respond to your requests.\n(c) If you ask, ask Allâh.\n(d) If you seek help, seek help from Allâh.\n(e) Know that if all the people get together in order to benefit you with something, they will not be able to benefit you in anything except what Allâh has decreed for you.
