And We gave Mûsâ (Moses) a clear proof of authority.","arabic":"يَسۡـَٔلُكَ أَهۡلُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ أَن تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيۡهِمۡ كِتَٰبٗا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِۚ فَقَدۡ سَأَلُواْ مُوسَىٰٓ أَكۡبَرَ مِن ذَٰلِكَ فَقَالُوٓاْ أَرِنَا ٱللَّهَ جَهۡرَةٗ فَأَخَذَتۡهُمُ ٱلصَّٰعِقَةُ بِظُلۡمِهِمۡۚ ثُمَّ ٱتَّخَذُواْ ٱلۡعِجۡلَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا جَآءَتۡهُمُ ٱلۡبَيِّنَٰتُ فَعَفَوۡنَا عَن ذَٰلِكَۚ وَءَاتَيۡنَا مُوسَىٰ سُلۡطَٰنٗا مُّبِينٗا","category":["4 (An-Nisa)","An-Nisa","Surah An-Nisa","Chapter An-Nisa","Nisa","Surah Nisa","Chapter Nisa","An Nisa","Surah An Nisa","Chapter An Nisa","Surah 4","Chapter 4","The Women","النِّسَاء"],"ayahNumber":646,"juzNumber":6,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"yasaluka ahlu al-kitābi an tunazzila ʿalayhim kitāban mina al-samāi faqad sa-alū mūsā akbara min dhālika faqālū arinā al-laha jahratan fa-akhadhathumu al-ṣāʿiqatu biẓul'mihim thumma ittakhadhū al-ʿij'la min baʿdi mā jāathumu al-bayinātu faʿafawnā ʿan dhālika waātaynā mūsā sul'ṭānan mubīnan ","translations":["Ask you","(the) People","(of) the Book","that","you bring down","to them","a book","from","the heaven","Then indeed","they (had) asked","Musa","greater","than","that","for they said","Show us","Allah","manifestly","so struck them","the thunderbolt","for their wrongdoing","Then","they took","the calf (for worship)","from","after","[what]","came to them","the clear proofs","then We forgave them","for","that","And We gave","Musa","an authority","clear","(153)"],"transliterationArr":["yasaluka","ahlu","al-kitābi","an","tunazzila","ʿalayhim","kitāban","mina","al-samāi","faqad","sa-alū","mūsā","akbara","min","dhālika","faqālū","arinā","al-laha","jahratan","fa-akhadhathumu","al-ṣāʿiqatu","biẓul'mihim","thumma","ittakhadhū","al-ʿij'la","min","baʿdi","mā","jāathumu","al-bayinātu","faʿafawnā","ʿan","dhālika","waātaynā","mūsā","sul'ṭānan","mubīnan",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1110],[2,1110,1740],[3,1740,2680],[4,2680,3540],[5,3540,4570],[6,4570,5540],[7,5540,6450],[8,6450,7300],[9,7300,9840],[10,9840,10640],[11,10640,11300],[12,11300,13750],[13,13750,14520],[14,14520,15400],[15,15400,16100],[16,16100,17240],[17,17240,19740],[18,19740,20250],[19,20250,21080],[20,21080,22540],[21,22540,23910],[22,23910,25140],[23,25140,26290],[24,26290,27690],[25,27690,28510],[26,28510,29350],[27,29350,30140],[28,30140,30760],[29,30760,31160],[30,31160,33680],[31,33680,35030],[32,35030,36250],[33,36250,36890],[34,36890,37900],[35,37900,39550],[36,39550,40270],[37,40270,41380],[38,41380,43365]]}}
