Then an Ansâri woman or man said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall we make a pulpit for you?\" He replied, \"If you wish.\" So they made a pulpit for him and when it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit [for delivering the Khutbah (religious talk)]. The date-palm cried like a child! The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم descended (from the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, \"It was crying for (missing) what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near it.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadîth No. 784).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"law anzalnā hādhā al-qur'āna ʿalā jabalin lara-aytahu khāshiʿan mutaṣaddiʿan min khashyati al-lahi watil'ka al-amthālu naḍribuhā lilnnāsi laʿallahum yatafakkarūna ","translations":["If","We (had) sent down","this","Quran","on","a mountain","surely you (would) have seen it","humbled","breaking asunder","from","(the) fear","(of) Allah","And these","examples","We present them","to the people","so that they may","give thought","(21)"],"transliterationArr":["law","anzalnā","hādhā","al-qur'āna","ʿalā","jabalin","lara-aytahu","khāshiʿan","mutaṣaddiʿan","min","khashyati","al-lahi","watil'ka","al-amthālu","naḍribuhā","lilnnāsi","laʿallahum","yatafakkarūna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,490],[2,490,2700],[3,2700,3250],[4,3250,4560],[5,4560,5200],[6,5200,5890],[7,5890,7340],[8,7340,8420],[9,8420,10790],[10,10790,11900],[11,11900,12780],[12,12780,15480],[13,15480,16310],[14,16310,17490],[15,17490,18700],[16,18700,20600],[17,20600,21790],[18,21790,26015]]}}
