{"name":"4:25","price":" 25. And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free, believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those (slaves) whom your right hands possess, and Allâh has full knowledge about your Faith; you are one from another. Wed them with the permission of their own folk (guardians, Auliyâ’ or masters) and give them their Mahr according to what is reasonable; they (the above said captive and slave-girls) should be chaste, not committing illegal sex, nor taking boy-friends. And after they have been taken in wedlock, if they commit illegal sexual intercourse, their punishment is half that for free (unmarried) women.[1] This is for him among you who is afraid of being harmed in his religion or in his body; but it is better for you that you practise self-restraint, and Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.","arabic":"وَمَن لَّمۡ يَسۡتَطِعۡ مِنكُمۡ طَوۡلًا أَن يَنكِحَ ٱلۡمُحۡصَنَٰتِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنَٰتِ فَمِن مَّا مَلَكَتۡ أَيۡمَٰنُكُم مِّن فَتَيَٰتِكُمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنَٰتِۚ وَٱللَّهُ أَعۡلَمُ بِإِيمَٰنِكُمۚ بَعۡضُكُم مِّنۢ بَعۡضٖۚ فَٱنكِحُوهُنَّ بِإِذۡنِ أَهۡلِهِنَّ وَءَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ بِٱلۡمَعۡرُوفِ مُحۡصَنَٰتٍ غَيۡرَ مُسَٰفِحَٰتٖ وَلَا مُتَّخِذَٰتِ أَخۡدَانٖۚ فَإِذَآ أُحۡصِنَّ فَإِنۡ أَتَيۡنَ بِفَٰحِشَةٖ فَعَلَيۡهِنَّ نِصۡفُ مَا عَلَى ٱلۡمُحۡصَنَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلۡعَذَابِۚ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنۡ خَشِيَ ٱلۡعَنَتَ مِنكُمۡۚ وَأَن تَصۡبِرُواْ خَيۡرٞ لَّكُمۡۗ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٞ رَّحِيمٞ","category":["4 (An-Nisa)","An-Nisa","Surah An-Nisa","Chapter An-Nisa","Nisa","Surah Nisa","Chapter Nisa","An Nisa","Surah An Nisa","Chapter An Nisa","Surah 4","Chapter 4","The Women","النِّسَاء"],"ayahNumber":518,"juzNumber":5,"footnotes":" (V.4:25) Female or male slaves (married or unmarried); if they commit illegal sexual intercourse, their punishment is fifty (50) lashes (half of that which is for free unmarried women); neither stoning to death nor exile.","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"waman lam yastaṭiʿ minkum ṭawlan an yankiḥa al-muḥ'ṣanāti al-mu'mināti famin mā malakat aymānukum min fatayātikumu al-mu'mināti wal-lahu aʿlamu biīmānikum baʿḍukum min baʿḍin fa-inkiḥūhunna bi-idh'ni ahlihinna waātūhunna ujūrahunna bil-maʿrūfi muḥ'ṣanātin ghayra musāfiḥātin walā muttakhidhāti akhdānin fa-idhā uḥ'ṣinna fa-in atayna bifāḥishatin faʿalayhinna niṣ'fu mā ʿalā al-muḥ'ṣanāti mina al-ʿadhābi dhālika liman khashiya al-ʿanata minkum wa-an taṣbirū khayrun lakum wal-lahu ghafūrun raḥīmun ","translations":["And whoever","(is) not","able to","among you","afford","to","marry","the free chaste","[the] believing women","then (marry) from","what","possess[ed]","your right hands","of","your slave girls ","(of) the believers","And Allah","knows best","about your faith","You","(are) from","(one) another","So marry them","with (the) permission","(of) their family","and give them","their bridal due","in a fair manner","(They should be) chaste","not","those who commit immorality","and not","those who take","secret lovers","Then when","they are married","and if","they commit","adultery","then for them","(is) half","(of) what","(is) on","the free chaste women","of","the punishment","That","(is) for whoever","fears","committing sin","among you","and that","you be patient","(is) better","for you","And Allah","(is) Oft-Forgiving","Most Merciful","(25)"],"transliterationArr":["waman","lam","yastaṭiʿ","minkum","ṭawlan","an","yankiḥa","al-muḥ'ṣanāti","al-mu'mināti","famin","mā","malakat","aymānukum","min","fatayātikumu","al-mu'mināti","wal-lahu","aʿlamu","biīmānikum","baʿḍukum","min","baʿḍin","fa-inkiḥūhunna","bi-idh'ni","ahlihinna","waātūhunna","ujūrahunna","bil-maʿrūfi","muḥ'ṣanātin","ghayra","musāfiḥātin","walā","muttakhidhāti","akhdānin","fa-idhā","uḥ'ṣinna","fa-in","atayna","bifāḥishatin","faʿalayhinna","niṣ'fu","mā","ʿalā","al-muḥ'ṣanāti","mina","al-ʿadhābi","dhālika","liman","khashiya","al-ʿanata","minkum","wa-an","taṣbirū","khayrun","lakum","wal-lahu","ghafūrun","raḥīmun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,460],[2,460,1130],[3,1130,2110],[4,2110,3530],[5,3530,4330],[6,4330,5850],[7,5850,7690],[8,7690,9170],[9,9170,9690],[10,9690,10620],[11,10620,11490],[12,11490,13390],[13,13390,13850],[14,13850,14910],[15,14910,15720],[16,15720,17220],[17,17220,17990],[18,17990,20100],[19,20100,22820],[20,22820,23860],[21,23860,24730],[22,24730,26920],[23,26920,28630],[24,28630,29620],[25,29620,30390],[26,30390,33280],[27,33280,34160],[28,34160,36000],[29,36000,38060],[30,38060,39830],[31,39830,41330],[32,41330,43820],[33,43820,45290],[34,45290,45950],[35,45950,48230],[36,48230,48780],[37,48780,50260],[38,50260,50940],[39,50940,52840],[40,52840,54630],[41,54630,56240],[42,56240,56890],[43,56890,57740],[44,57740,59280],[45,59280,61630],[46,61630,62130],[47,62130,62660],[48,62660,63060],[49,63060,64610],[50,64610,64960],[51,64960,67300],[52,67300,68560],[53,68560,69110],[54,69110,69790],[55,69790,70590],[56,70590,72560],[57,72560,73810],[58,73810,74860],[59,74860,75790],[60,75790,76500],[61,76500,77470],[62,77470,78590],[63,78590,80705]]}}
