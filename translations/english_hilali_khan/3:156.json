Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed,\" so that Allâh may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allâh that gives life and causes death. And Allâh is All-Seer of what you do.","arabic":"يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَا تَكُونُواْ كَٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَقَالُواْ لِإِخۡوَٰنِهِمۡ إِذَا ضَرَبُواْ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ أَوۡ كَانُواْ غُزّٗى لَّوۡ كَانُواْ عِندَنَا مَا مَاتُواْ وَمَا قُتِلُواْ لِيَجۡعَلَ ٱللَّهُ ذَٰلِكَ حَسۡرَةٗ فِي قُلُوبِهِمۡۗ وَٱللَّهُ يُحۡيِۦ وَيُمِيتُۗ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعۡمَلُونَ بَصِيرٞ","category":["3 (Al-Imran)","Al-Imran","Surah Al-Imran","Chapter Al-Imran","Imran","Surah Imran","Chapter Imran","Al Imran","Surah Al Imran","Chapter Al Imran","Surah 3","Chapter 3","The Family of Imran","آل عِمرَان"],"ayahNumber":449,"juzNumber":4,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"yāayyuhā alladhīna āmanū lā takūnū ka-alladhīna kafarū waqālū li-ikh'wānihim idhā ḍarabū fī al-arḍi aw kānū ghuzzan law kānū ʿindanā mā mātū wamā qutilū liyajʿala al-lahu dhālika ḥasratan fī qulūbihim wal-lahu yuḥ'yī wayumītu wal-lahu bimā taʿmalūna baṣīrun ","translations":["O you","who","believe[d]","(Do) not","be","like those who","disbelieved","and they said","about their brothers","when","they traveled","in","the earth","or","they were","fighting","If","they had been","with us","not","they (would have) died","and not","they (would have) been killed","So makes","Allah","that","a regret","in","their hearts","And Allah","gives life","and causes death","and Allah","of what","you do","(is) All-Seer","(156)"],"transliterationArr":["yāayyuhā","alladhīna","āmanū","lā","takūnū","ka-alladhīna","kafarū","waqālū","li-ikh'wānihim","idhā","ḍarabū","fī","al-arḍi","aw","kānū","ghuzzan","law","kānū","ʿindanā","mā","mātū","wamā","qutilū","liyajʿala","al-lahu","dhālika","ḥasratan","fī","qulūbihim","wal-lahu","yuḥ'yī","wayumītu","wal-lahu","bimā","taʿmalūna","baṣīrun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,2910],[2,2910,3940],[3,3940,5160],[4,5160,5550],[5,5550,6630],[6,6630,7890],[7,7890,8860],[8,8860,9840],[9,9840,11500],[10,11500,13040],[11,13040,14690],[12,14690,15210],[13,15210,16060],[14,16060,16330],[15,16330,17160],[16,17160,17520],[17,17520,18410],[18,18410,19130],[19,19130,19650],[20,19650,20540],[21,20540,22050],[22,22050,22450],[23,22450,23380],[24,23380,23720],[25,23720,24770],[26,24770,25850],[27,25850,26770],[28,26770,27560],[29,27560,29420],[30,29420,29800],[31,29800,31470],[32,31470,32530],[33,32530,33370],[34,33370,35480],[35,35480,36650],[36,36650,37270],[37,37270,38580],[38,38580,40825]]}}
