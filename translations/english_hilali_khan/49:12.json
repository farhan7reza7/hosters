This one used not to save himself from being soiled with his urine, and the other used to go about with calumnies (among the people to rouse hostilities, e.g., one goes to a person and tells him that so-and-so says about him such and such evil things).\" The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم then asked for a green branch of a date-palm tree, split it into two pieces and planted one on each grave and said, \"It is hoped that their punishment may be abated till those two pieces of the branch get dried.\" *** (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadîth No.78).\n* Najsh means to offer a high price for something in order to allure another customer who is interested in the thing.\n**A Qattât is a person who conveys disagreeable, false information from one person to another with the intention of causing harm and enmity between them.\n***This action was a kind of invocation on the part of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم for the deceased persons.
