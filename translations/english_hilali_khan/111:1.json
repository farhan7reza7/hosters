If I inform you that cavalrymen are proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?’ They said, ‘We have never heard you telling a lie.’ Then he said, ‘I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.’ Abû Lahab said, ‘May you perish! You gathered us only for this reason?’ Then Abu Lahab went away. So [Sûrat Al-Masad] ‘Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!’ was revealed. (V.111:1).
