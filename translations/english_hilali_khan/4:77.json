{"name":"4:77","price":" 77. Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands (from fighting) and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât but when the fighting was ordained for them, behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allâh or even more. They say: \"Our Lord! Why have you ordained for us fighting? Would that You had granted us respite for a short period?\" Say: \"Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is (far) better for him who fears Allâh, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to a scalish thread in the long slit of a date-stone.","arabic":"أَلَمۡ تَرَ إِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ قِيلَ لَهُمۡ كُفُّوٓاْ أَيۡدِيَكُمۡ وَأَقِيمُواْ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُواْ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ فَلَمَّا كُتِبَ عَلَيۡهِمُ ٱلۡقِتَالُ إِذَا فَرِيقٞ مِّنۡهُمۡ يَخۡشَوۡنَ ٱلنَّاسَ كَخَشۡيَةِ ٱللَّهِ أَوۡ أَشَدَّ خَشۡيَةٗۚ وَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا لِمَ كَتَبۡتَ عَلَيۡنَا ٱلۡقِتَالَ لَوۡلَآ أَخَّرۡتَنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٖ قَرِيبٖۗ قُلۡ مَتَٰعُ ٱلدُّنۡيَا قَلِيلٞ وَٱلۡأٓخِرَةُ خَيۡرٞ لِّمَنِ ٱتَّقَىٰ وَلَا تُظۡلَمُونَ فَتِيلًا","category":["4 (An-Nisa)","An-Nisa","Surah An-Nisa","Chapter An-Nisa","Nisa","Surah Nisa","Chapter Nisa","An Nisa","Surah An Nisa","Chapter An Nisa","Surah 4","Chapter 4","The Women","النِّسَاء"],"ayahNumber":570,"juzNumber":5,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"alam tara ilā alladhīna qīla lahum kuffū aydiyakum wa-aqīmū al-ṣalata waātū al-zakata falammā kutiba ʿalayhimu al-qitālu idhā farīqun min'hum yakhshawna al-nāsa kakhashyati al-lahi aw ashadda khashyatan waqālū rabbanā lima katabta ʿalaynā al-qitāla lawlā akhartanā ilā ajalin qarībin qul matāʿu al-dun'yā qalīlun wal-ākhiratu khayrun limani ittaqā walā tuẓ'lamūna fatīlan ","translations":["Have not","you seen","[towards]","those who","(when) it was said","to them","Restrain","your hands","and establish","the prayer","and give","the zakah","Then when","was ordained","on them","the fighting","then","a group","of them","[they] fear","the people","as (they) fear","Allah","or","more intense","fear","and they said","Our Lord","why","have You ordained","upon us","[the] fighting","Why not","You postpone (it for) us","to","a term","near","Say","Enjoyment","(of) the world","(is) little","and the Hereafter","(is) better","for whoever","fears (Allah)","and not","you will be wronged","(even as much as) a hair on a date-seed","(77)"],"transliterationArr":["alam","tara","ilā","alladhīna","qīla","lahum","kuffū","aydiyakum","wa-aqīmū","al-ṣalata","waātū","al-zakata","falammā","kutiba","ʿalayhimu","al-qitālu","idhā","farīqun","min'hum","yakhshawna","al-nāsa","kakhashyati","al-lahi","aw","ashadda","khashyatan","waqālū","rabbanā","lima","katabta","ʿalaynā","al-qitāla","lawlā","akhartanā","ilā","ajalin","qarībin","qul","matāʿu","al-dun'yā","qalīlun","wal-ākhiratu","khayrun","limani","ittaqā","walā","tuẓ'lamūna","fatīlan",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,650],[2,650,1100],[3,1100,1420],[4,1420,2460],[5,2460,3180],[6,3180,3770],[7,3770,5820],[8,5820,7040],[9,7040,8020],[10,8020,9130],[11,9130,9930],[12,9930,11000],[13,11000,12450],[14,12450,13080],[15,13080,14070],[16,14070,15150],[17,15150,15760],[18,15760,16600],[19,16600,18120],[20,18120,19190],[21,19190,22150],[22,22150,23280],[23,23280,24620],[24,24620,25710],[25,25710,26550],[26,26550,26980],[27,26980,27780],[28,27780,28930],[29,28930,30070],[30,30070,31030],[31,31030,31430],[32,31430,32320],[33,32320,33110],[34,33110,34220],[35,34220,36660],[36,36660,39250],[37,39250,41100],[38,41100,42610],[39,42610,43250],[40,43250,44740],[41,44740,45640],[42,45640,46460],[43,46460,47450],[44,47450,48340],[45,48340,50400],[46,50400,51200],[47,51200,51910],[48,51910,52780],[49,52780,53310],[50,53310,54540],[51,54540,56335]]}}
