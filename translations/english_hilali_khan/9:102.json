There, we met men who, (by) half of their bodies looked like the most handsome human beings you have ever seen, and (by) the other half, the ugliest human beings you have ever seen. Those two visitors said to those men: ‘Go and dip yourselves in that river.’ So they dipped themselves therein and then came to us, their ugliness having disappeared and they were in the most handsome shape. The visitors said, ‘This is the ‘Adn Paradise, and that is your dwelling place.’ Then they added, ‘As for those people who were half ugly and half handsome, they were those who have mixed deeds that were good with deeds that were evil, but Allâh forgave them.’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.196).","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"waākharūna iʿ'tarafū bidhunūbihim khalaṭū ʿamalan ṣāliḥan waākhara sayyi-an ʿasā al-lahu an yatūba ʿalayhim inna al-laha ghafūrun raḥīmun ","translations":["And others","(who have) acknowledged","their sins","They had mixed","a deed","righteous","(with) other","(that was) evil","Perhaps","Allah","[that]","will turn (in mercy)","to them","Indeed","Allah","(is) Oft-Forgiving","Most Merciful","(102)"],"transliterationArr":["waākharūna","iʿ'tarafū","bidhunūbihim","khalaṭū","ʿamalan","ṣāliḥan","waākhara","sayyi-an","ʿasā","al-lahu","an","yatūba","ʿalayhim","inna","al-laha","ghafūrun","raḥīmun",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,1530],[2,1530,2740],[3,2740,4290],[4,4290,5270],[5,5270,6480],[6,6480,8930],[7,8930,9960],[8,9960,11120],[9,11120,11620],[10,11620,12630],[11,12630,12910],[12,12910,14510],[13,14510,15810],[14,15810,17640],[15,17640,18710],[16,18710,19560],[17,19560,22985]]}}
