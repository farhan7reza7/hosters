{"name":"3:152","price":" 152. And Allâh did indeed fulfil His Promise to you when you were killing them (your enemy) with His Permission; until (the moment) you lost your courage and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed after He showed you (of the booty) which you love. Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then He made you flee from them (your enemy), that He might test you. But surely, He forgave you, and Allâh is Most Gracious to the believers.","arabic":"وَلَقَدۡ صَدَقَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَعۡدَهُۥٓ إِذۡ تَحُسُّونَهُم بِإِذۡنِهِۦۖ حَتَّىٰٓ إِذَا فَشِلۡتُمۡ وَتَنَٰزَعۡتُمۡ فِي ٱلۡأَمۡرِ وَعَصَيۡتُم مِّنۢ بَعۡدِ مَآ أَرَىٰكُم مَّا تُحِبُّونَۚ مِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ ٱلدُّنۡيَا وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرِيدُ ٱلۡأٓخِرَةَۚ ثُمَّ صَرَفَكُمۡ عَنۡهُمۡ لِيَبۡتَلِيَكُمۡۖ وَلَقَدۡ عَفَا عَنكُمۡۗ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو فَضۡلٍ عَلَى ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ","category":["3 (Al-Imran)","Al-Imran","Surah Al-Imran","Chapter Al-Imran","Imran","Surah Imran","Chapter Imran","Al Imran","Surah Al Imran","Chapter Al Imran","Surah 3","Chapter 3","The Family of Imran","آل عِمرَان"],"ayahNumber":445,"juzNumber":4,"footnotes":"","lang":"en","version":{"key":"english_hilali_khan","direction":"ltr","language_iso_code":"en","version":"1.1.0","last_update":1577394000,"title":"English Translation - Hilali and Khan","description":"Translation of the Quran meanings into English by Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Muhsen Khan"},"meta":{"transliteration":"walaqad ṣadaqakumu al-lahu waʿdahu idh taḥussūnahum bi-idh'nihi ḥattā idhā fashil'tum watanāzaʿtum fī al-amri waʿaṣaytum min baʿdi mā arākum mā tuḥibbūna minkum man yurīdu al-dun'yā waminkum man yurīdu al-ākhirata thumma ṣarafakum ʿanhum liyabtaliyakum walaqad ʿafā ʿankum wal-lahu dhū faḍlin ʿalā al-mu'minīna ","translations":["And certainly","fulfilled to you","Allah","His promise","when","you were killing them","by His permission","until","when","you lost courage","and you fell into dispute","concerning","the order","and you disobeyed","from","after","[what]","He (had) shown you","what","you love","Among you","(are some) who","desire","the world","and among you","(are some) who","desire","the Hereafter","Then","He diverted you","from them","so that He may test you","And surely","He forgave","you","And Allah","(is the) Possessor","(of) Bounty","for","the believers","(152)"],"transliterationArr":["walaqad","ṣadaqakumu","al-lahu","waʿdahu","idh","taḥussūnahum","bi-idh'nihi","ḥattā","idhā","fashil'tum","watanāzaʿtum","fī","al-amri","waʿaṣaytum","min","baʿdi","mā","arākum","mā","tuḥibbūna","minkum","man","yurīdu","al-dun'yā","waminkum","man","yurīdu","al-ākhirata","thumma","ṣarafakum","ʿanhum","liyabtaliyakum","walaqad","ʿafā","ʿankum","wal-lahu","dhū","faḍlin","ʿalā","al-mu'minīna",null],"verseTiming":[[1,0,810],[2,810,1800],[3,1800,2850],[4,2850,5080],[5,5080,5400],[6,5400,7660],[7,7660,8760],[8,8760,11440],[9,11440,11980],[10,11980,13230],[11,13230,14900],[12,14900,15150],[13,15150,15940],[14,15940,17160],[15,17160,18780],[16,18780,19480],[17,19480,21250],[18,21250,22290],[19,22290,23290],[20,23290,26740],[21,26740,28380],[22,28380,28890],[23,28890,30320],[24,30320,31420],[25,31420,33230],[26,33230,34200],[27,34200,35410],[28,35410,37170],[29,37170,38130],[30,38130,39340],[31,39340,40200],[32,40200,42410],[33,42410,43170],[34,43170,44000],[35,44000,45790],[36,45790,46890],[37,46890,47260],[38,47260,48150],[39,48150,48590],[40,48590,51325]]}}
